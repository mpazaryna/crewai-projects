The search results provide a range of optimal posting times. The consistent advice is that weekdays are the best days to post.

I now know the final answer. 

Final Answer: 
Based on the research, AI-enhanced creativity and AI-generated art are currently trending on Instagram, leading to increased viewer engagement. The popular AI-related Instagram pages such as @openai and @evolving.ai are actively sharing such content. The hashtag #ai is also widely used.

For optimal reach and engagement, posts should ideally be made on weekdays, specifically between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Posting early in the morning around 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. can also be effective, with Tuesdays and Wednesdays showing potential for extended engagement times.

Please note that these trends and optimal times may vary depending on the target audience's behavior and the platform's ever-changing algorithms. Therefore, it's crucial to continually monitor performance and adjust the strategy as needed.
