Check out these new findings to keep your social strategy on the cutting edge:The AI Trend: Companies that prioritize AI for customer service can expect 25% higher revenue compared to those that focus only on AI for productivity, according to a recent study by Accenture. (Better get those chatbots up to speed on social!)The Platform Trend: With a potential TikTok ban looming over the U.S., eMarketer predicts a dip in social commerce as brands and audiences start turning their attentions elsewhere. So if your brand has a strong U.S. base of TikTok shoppers, it might be wise to get platforms like Instagram ready so you can fill in any gaps at a moment’s notice.The ROI Trend: In our ongoing quest to find social ROI, we dug even deeper into what consumers really want from brands on social. Good news, we found their 3 favorite types of content: something new, something funny, and something inspiring. Do you have these in your content mix? Get more ideas in our Social Media Consumer Report.What are the top social trends for 2024?1. The AI Trend2. The Platform Trend3. The ROI Trend4. Industry Trends1. The AI TrendAI forces brands to redefine authenticityGenerative AI created a seismic shift when it broke into the mainstream in 2022 and sparked a whole range of emotions typically reserved for fellow humans.Interest was so high that from 2022 to 2023, topics on learning about AI increased by 550%, according to an analysis we conducted of over 15,500 news articles and blogs.And social marketers have jumped on the bandwagon.Organizations report that they’re planning to double their use of AI across various activities—even tripling or quadrupling it in some cases.318%increase in how much organizations plan to use AI for customer support activities in 2024Source260%increase in how much organizations plan to use AI for editing images in 2024SourceGenerative AI may be a source of hope for busy professionals like you, but it’s not without risks. Our survey revealed that audiences are not necessarily embracing AI and AI-generated content as much as social marketers are flocking to use it.\xa0Source: Hootsuite Social Media Consumer 2024 SurveyDifferent generations also have different levels of trust towards AI-generated content, according to our survey.\xa0Gen Z, for example, are more likely to claim they know what’s real and what’s created by AI better than other generations. They’re also more likely to trust and engage with AI content. On the other hand, baby boomers are the opposite on all accounts.\xa0AI for the agesThinking about social content generated by AI, rate your agreement with the following statements.Bar chart outlining generational preferences around AI generated content. While 30% of Baby Boomers and Gen Xers say awareness of AI content will discourage engagement and trust, Millenials and Gen Z are most likely to recognize AI content and still trust it. Sample: 4,420 respondentsSource: Hootsuite Social Media Consumer 2024 Survey AI is inevitable on social, and scaling back on its use now would be like reverting from computers to typewriters.To thrive in this new environment, marketers and brands need to move beyond defining “real” and “authentic” based on whether something was created exclusively by a human.\xa0In 2024, the most successful brands will redefine “authenticity.” It’s not about who (or what) creates your content anymore; it’s about the brand experience your content creates for the customer.Does it feel right? Does it reinforce the brand? Does it work? Get those right and you can dismiss questions about whether a bot made it with a shrug.\u2028How to work smarter with AIKnow your audience and how they feel about AIIt’s timeless advice for a reason. A deep understanding of your audience can help you gather insights on whether factors such as age, culture, geography, or interests have influence on their perception of AI.Decide which tasks to keep on your plate, and which to delegateAI makes a great assistant—but you still have to run the show. It’s up to you to delegate which aspects of the job AI can support, and which aspects need a more delicate hand (and nuanced brain, tbh).Create AI policies and best practices for social mediaMake sure your team and organization are aligned in how you use AI. If you have rules and regulations in place, potential nightmares like angry customers and unapproved posts can be avoided.\xa0\xa0Dig deeper into our AI dataGet the full report →Look into your industry’s futureUnveil new data and industry insights to skyrocket your social ROI in 2024.01.

The Platform TrendStrategic brands commit to their champion social platformsBe where your audience is, they said.But when your audience is everywhere, that’s a tall order—and the average social media user logs into about seven platforms each month. Seven.For brands, maintaining a presence on multiple networks is hard. In fact, it’s such a challenge for organizations, it’s emerged as the top ROI concern for social media.Orgs fear the ROI impact of being on so many platformsWhich of the following issues do you think contribute to your organization’s concern about ROI for social media activities?Respondents\' concerns for social media ROI: 52% - Time/budget on multiple platforms, 35% - Uncertainty in success metrics, 34% - Attribution uncertainty, 33% - Metric-business link, 31% - Social strategy uncertainty, 25% - Rising costs, 19% - High costs, 18% - Short-term impact, 14% - Long-term impact.Sample: 4,281 respondentsSource: Hootsuite Social Trends 2024 Survey So why does it take so much time and energy to be active—and thrive—on several networks?For one, social content needs to be tailored to the unique audiences, lingo, trends, hashtags, word counts, and visual specs of each platform.Also, platforms change constantly. New user and advertising features are released so often that more than half of marketers say it’s difficult to keep up.7is the number of platforms the average social media user logs into each monthSource58%of marketers feel that the pace at which networks release new user and advertising features makes it hard to keep upSourceToday, instead of trying to do everything, everywhere, all at once, and letting time, money, resources, and results fall by the wayside (the historical norm), organizations are actually doing something about it—using ROI to figure out their next moves.Take Twitter/X, for example. The majority (60%) of organizations have a presence there, but only a third of them feel strongly that it benefits their business—which might explain the 7% drop in brand use.So organizations are more willing than even to say buh-bye to platforms and strategies that aren’t meeting their definition of ROI. They’re finally prioritizing their own platform-by-platform ROI scores and making business decisions accordingly.No value, no point: Brands leave some of the social platform giantsChange in platform use for businesses from 2022 to 2023Graph regarding change in platform use for businesses from 2022 to 2023. Results show +16% TikTok, +5% LinkedIn, +1% Instagram, +0% YouTube, +0% Snapchat, -1% Facebook, -7% X (Formerly Twitter), -11% Pinterest, -18% Whatsapp Samples: 3,891 respondents (2024) and 9,422 respondents (2023)Sources: Hootsuite Social Trends 2024 Survey and Hootsuite Social Trends 2023 SurveyIn 2024, strategic organizations will push back against unjustified expectations to be on every platform. They’ll unlock their top-performing channels based on ROI, and focus their attention on those—and only those. If they’re really confident (and brave), they might even abandon one or two altogether.Because mastering a few key platforms is surely better than being so-so at many.How to decode (and declutter) your social platform mixRun a social media audit for platform intelThis will help you identify your hero platforms—and your duds—so you can make informed decisions about how to approach your social strategy moving forward. Get started with our Social Media Audit Guide.Put your platforms in an ROI showdown Calculate the ROI of every platform you use and weigh them against each other. Find a channel that’s lagging behind? Even if it generates a positive ROI, it may not be worth the investment if there’s greater potential for growth with your other platforms.Master the art of (proper) cross-postingWe don’t recommend the copy-and-paste method of cross-posting, but there are ways to do it right. The top rule is to align your content with the norms, best practices, and formats of each platform. Check out this strategy guide for some cross-posting pro tips.Brands like yours are making bold moves on socialSee how they do it, and find all the advice (and confidence) you need to follow suit.Get the full report3. The ROI TrendEntertainment fuels the social ROI engineBefore you quit reading, we get it. Entertainment can be an intimidating word, especially if you work in a “serious” organization (let alone a regulated industry). Can you even connect entertainment to something quantifiable, like ROI?\xa0But consumers are saying it loud and clear. After staying in touch with family and friends, the top reason they use social media is to be entertained and to mentally unwind, according to our Social Trends 2024 Survey.You know what else they said? That they don’t like it when brands are too focused on self-promotion.\xa034%of consumers say “too much self-promotion” is a major turn-off in how they perceive brands on socialSource56%of consumers think that brands should be more relatable on socialSourceThe problem is, brands seem to have other ideas: Almost half of marketers publish product or brand updates or news multiple times a week, according to our survey. That’s a huge disconnect between what brands are posting and what people really want to see.\xa0And it gets worse.While organizations are yammering about themselves, they also use engagement as the top metric to demonstrate ROI.48%of marketers publish product or brand updates multiple times a weekSource68%of marketers report being concerned about the ROI of their social activitiesSourceHow can you demonstrate ROI through engagement metrics when you’re giving the audience exactly what they don’t want to engage with?It’s no surprise then that over two-thirds of social marketers report being concerned about the ROI of their social activities. When brands measure success in ways that don’t add up, ROI will be hard to come by.Brands cling to engagement to demonstrate ROIWhich metrics does your organization most commonly use to demonstrate the return on investment of its social activities?In response to the question "Which metrics does your organization most commonly use to demonstrate the return on investment of its social activities?": 69% engagement, 51% impressions.views, 49% followers, 43% clicks/traffic, 21% leads, 14% sales/revenue, 4% time spent on site/app, 3% sentiment, 3% share of voice, 2% pipeline, 2% survey-based brand awareness.Sample: 4,268 respondentsSource: Hootsuite Social Trends 2024 SurveyIn 2024, brands that publish entertaining content on social will succeed in winning eyeballs, engagement, and (eventually) market share away from brands that keep on publishing the same old stuff.You don’t need to overthink it either. “Entertainment” simply boils down to providing enjoyment, according to the Oxford English Dictionary—that could be finding inspiration, getting excited, feeling moved, or learning something new.Be your relatable person-self, not your super-serious-brand-self. After all, social media is not a place where you talk at someone. It’s an interactive space where the exchange of value is a two-way street.This isn’t a strategy you can pivot to overnight (obvs). But if your old, promotion-heavy strategy isn’t working as well as it used to, it’s time to get back to the true strength of social media: building brand awareness, affinity, and long-term relationships with your audience through engaging, entertaining social content.\u2028How entertainment helps you win socialWhen it comes to content, follow your audience’s leadDon’t assume you know what your followers want to see. Grab the opportunity to ask them what they want through polls and Q&As. You can also run experiments with new content types or tone of voice. Once you see results, start tweaking future posts and keep testing and iterating as you go.\u2028Let social be the long gameDon’t rush into “smashing those goals.” Social is best for building brand equity, which takes time. Don’t revert to your old, self-promotion-y ways either. No one likes a hard sell, and letting them flock to you will be so much more effective in the long run.Make social relationships the foundation of your ROIMeasure how far engagements go beyond social and across your larger business goals. This gives your social media efforts a higher purpose and makes them rooted in customer value and authentic relationships.New industry insights, unveiledEducation TrendsLearn how to make your strategy too cool for schoolRead nowGovernment TrendsLay down the law for your 2024 social strategyRead nowFinancial Services TrendsRead the report for a strategy you can bank onRead nowHealthcare TrendsGive your 2024 social strategy a boost(er)Read nowNonprofit TrendsBuild a social strategy that keeps on givingRead nowGet more insights… or FOMO.

The Hootsuite page provides valuable insights about Social Media Trends in 2024. It mentions the importance of AI in customer service and content creation, the shift in platform preferences due to a potential TikTok ban, and the types of content that consumers prefer on social media. However, it doesn't specifically mention Instagram trends or optimal posting times. I'll try to open the next link about Instagram trends for small businesses.

Tell me more! At the forefront of social media since 2010, Instagram has become not only a staple in our phones’ app libraries but also in our everyday lives. With\xa0more than 2 billion active users this fall, the social media giant’s popularity is projected to grow to even greater heights over the coming year. Hoffmann Murtaugh has the exclusive insights every social media marketer needs to know about the Instagram trend forecast for 2022.\xa0Get Ready For A Ride On The Carousel, The Latest Instagram Trend!Instagram users rejoice in knowing that their ‘weekly photo dumps’ aren’t going anywhere in 2022! While the emerging Instagram trend of sharing a user’s top 10 photos to summarize their week is typically for fun, the feature also can positively impact a brand’s marketing strategy. With more content for Instagram users to scroll through and engage within a carousel, consumers are spending more time looking at a brand’s post, and ultimately, at a brand’s Instagram page overall. Plan on seeing more tailored, curated Instagram carousel posts as we head into the new year.\xa0Enhanced Instagram Shopping User ExperienceWhether avoidance of COVID-19 pandemic surges or new habits that have been formed, online shopping is huge. In fact, 54 percent of consumers prefer to shop online. Expect Instagram Shopping to take off in 2022 as more brands become acquainted with the digital storefront feature. Seamlessly and organically integrated within the app, Instagram takes consumers through the entire purchasing experience. Businesses can maximize their sales to broader audiences by exploring all Instagram Shopping has to offer in 2022.\xa0The Continued Rise Of Influencer MarketingHave you purchased a product from someone’s Instagram recommendation? Instagram has been a pioneer in providing a platform for users to follow people whose lifestyles, fashion, fitness, advice, piques their interest and inspiration. As social media influencers gain traction and develop their own communities on Instagram, brands are taking notice. Brands need to start investing in paid partnerships with Instagram users relevant to their target audience. 2022 will expose the full potential of influencers (of all account sizes) in amplifying a brand’s social media marketing efforts.\xa0Gen Z Has Entered The ChatSpeaking of influence—let’s talk about some of the youngest Instagram users driving the incoming trends to fleeting success. Making up approximately 20 percent of the population, Generation Z (those born between 1997-2012) Instagram users have utilized many of the social media network’s unique features to share creative, engaging content with friends, families, and classmates. In a current world of remote learning and limited social gatherings, Instagram allows Gen Z to make up fun dances on Reels, share their music favorites on Stories, and thrifted finds from Shopping. Not only does this generation make use of Instagram’s capabilities, but Gen Z also sparks a conversation for social change. These young users encourage their favorite brands to stand up for causes that matter most to them. Don’t underestimate the power of Gen Z and how they will reshape the narrative on brands on Instagram in 2022.Which Instagram trend from 2021 was your favorite? What feature are you most looking forward to utilizing for your marketing strategy in 2022?

The page from Hoffmann Murtaugh provides insights on four key Instagram trends for 2022:
1. The use of Instagram carousels for sharing multiple photos at once, which can increase user engagement.
2. The rise of Instagram Shopping, allowing businesses to sell products directly through the app.
3. The continued growth of influencer marketing, with brands partnering with influencers to reach their target audiences.
4. The influence of Generation Z on Instagram trends, with this demographic using the platform to share creative content, spark social change, and interact with brands.

However, I still need to find information on optimal posting times and audience preferences on Instagram. I'll search the internet again for these topics.

time to post on Instagram. Instagram’s visual nature makes it a desirable marketing platform for brands to get their offerings in front of as many eyes as possible, and knowing the best times to post on Instagram can be a major benefit to your social media strategy.\nRemember: with Instagram as a discovery platform of trends, brands, products or services, it’s important to get high-quality photos and content in front of potential consumers’ eyes at the right time.\nLearn how to identify your best times to post on Instagram with a free trial of Sprout Social and test our ViralPost® feature.\nStart a free Sprout Social trial\nDisclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded globally (not by Central Time), meaning you should be able to publish with the times provided in any timezone and see positive engagement results. Number of engagements represents total engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level engagement times. We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in 2024?\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\n\nWhen are the best times to post Reels on Instagram?\nAre the best times to post on Instagram different for static posts versus Reels? Perhaps there’s a definitive answer to that question, however, our data source is inclusive of posts, Stories and Reels. The information in this article should guide you to uncover the best times to post any content on Instagram to see positive engagement, whether it’s a static post, a Story with polls or a creative Reel.\nThe best times to post Reels on Instagram will be similar to our data above: weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. Our optimal send time data for Instagram is aggregate for Posts, Reels and Stories – both images and videos.\nFor that reason, we recommend you test posting Reels at different times to uncover the highest engagement times for you. Keep in mind that several factors go into Reels’ performance, whether it’s using trending sounds, the Instagram algorithm or having an engaging video hook to capture your audience’s attention.\n\n\nWhat is the best day and time to post on Instagram?\nWe know the best time to post on Instagram overall, but what about for each day of the week? If you’re looking for the best day and time to post on Instagram, read the analysis below.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Monday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Mondays is from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. While there’s decent engagement from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., optimal send and engagement times are those few hours during a typical lunch break.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Tuesday\nThere’s nearly double the highest engagement times on Tuesdays than there are on Mondays. The best time to post on Instagram on Tuesdays is from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Wednesday\nWednesdays see the highest engagement periods than any other day of the week, with even the moderately high engagement times spanning more hours than Tuesdays or Thursdays. The best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Thursday\nSimilar to Wednesdays, the best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and again at 2 p.m. The 1 p.m. hour drops slightly in engagement.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Friday\nBy the time users have reached the weekend, peak engagement hours dip; however, the majority of the workday still captures moderate engagement. Yet the best time to post on Instagram on Fridays is at 11 a.m., but can see almost as much engagement the few hours prior and after that peak engagement time.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Saturday\nGenerally speaking, we’ve noticed that Saturdays and Sundays have less engagement during the rest of the week across most social platforms. Even with Instagram, there’s a significant decrease during the weekends than during weekdays. With that in mind, you’ll still see light to average engagement on the app. The best time to post on Instagram on Saturdays is 9 a.m. to noon, in relation to the rest of the day.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Sunday\nSimilar to Saturdays, we’ve noticed Sundays have less engagement throughout the day across most, if not all, social platforms. In relation to the day itself, the best time to post on Instagram on Sundays is 10 a.m. to noon.\n\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in the UK?\nThe overall best time to post on Instagram in the UK is weekdays between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Midweek, engagement rates remain high until 4 p.m. Things are noticeably quieter at the weekend across many social platforms, including Instagram in the UK. Taking this into account, the best time to post on Saturday is 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 10 am to 12 p.m. on Sundays. If Instagram is the platform your UK audience engages with most, remember your industry, business goals and content will also play a part in the success of your social posts.\n\n\nWhat are the best times to post on Instagram by industry?\nThere’s no definitive answer to what the best times to post on Instagram are. We can only offer insight with the data we have. Industry is just one factor that plays into the success of your social posts.

Check out these new findings to keep your social strategy on the cutting edge:The AI Trend: Companies that prioritize AI for customer service can expect 25% higher revenue compared to those that focus only on AI for productivity, according to a recent study by Accenture. (Better get those chatbots up to speed on social!)The Platform Trend: With a potential TikTok ban looming over the U.S., eMarketer predicts a dip in social commerce as brands and audiences start turning their attentions elsewhere. So if your brand has a strong U.S. base of TikTok shoppers, it might be wise to get platforms like Instagram ready so you can fill in any gaps at a moment’s notice.The ROI Trend: In our ongoing quest to find social ROI, we dug even deeper into what consumers really want from brands on social. Good news, we found their 3 favorite types of content: something new, something funny, and something inspiring. Do you have these in your content mix? Get more ideas in our Social Media Consumer Report.What are the top social trends for 2024?1. The AI Trend2. The Platform Trend3. The ROI Trend4. Industry Trends1. The AI TrendAI forces brands to redefine authenticityGenerative AI created a seismic shift when it broke into the mainstream in 2022 and sparked a whole range of emotions typically reserved for fellow humans.Interest was so high that from 2022 to 2023, topics on learning about AI increased by 550%, according to an analysis we conducted of over 15,500 news articles and blogs.And social marketers have jumped on the bandwagon.Organizations report that they’re planning to double their use of AI across various activities—even tripling or quadrupling it in some cases.318%increase in how much organizations plan to use AI for customer support activities in 2024Source260%increase in how much organizations plan to use AI for editing images in 2024SourceGenerative AI may be a source of hope for busy professionals like you, but it’s not without risks. Our survey revealed that audiences are not necessarily embracing AI and AI-generated content as much as social marketers are flocking to use it.\xa0Source: Hootsuite Social Media Consumer 2024 SurveyDifferent generations also have different levels of trust towards AI-generated content, according to our survey.\xa0Gen Z, for example, are more likely to claim they know what’s real and what’s created by AI better than other generations. They’re also more likely to trust and engage with AI content. On the other hand, baby boomers are the opposite on all accounts.\xa0AI for the agesThinking about social content generated by AI, rate your agreement with the following statements.Bar chart outlining generational preferences around AI generated content. While 30% of Baby Boomers and Gen Xers say awareness of AI content will discourage engagement and trust, Millenials and Gen Z are most likely to recognize AI content and still trust it. Sample: 4,420 respondentsSource: Hootsuite Social Media Consumer 2024 Survey AI is inevitable on social, and scaling back on its use now would be like reverting from computers to typewriters.To thrive in this new environment, marketers and brands need to move beyond defining “real” and “authentic” based on whether something was created exclusively by a human.\xa0In 2024, the most successful brands will redefine “authenticity.” It’s not about who (or what) creates your content anymore; it’s about the brand experience your content creates for the customer.Does it feel right? Does it reinforce the brand? Does it work? Get those right and you can dismiss questions about whether a bot made it with a shrug.\u2028How to work smarter with AIKnow your audience and how they feel about AIIt’s timeless advice for a reason. A deep understanding of your audience can help you gather insights on whether factors such as age, culture, geography, or interests have influence on their perception of AI.Decide which tasks to keep on your plate, and which to delegateAI makes a great assistant—but you still have to run the show. It’s up to you to delegate which aspects of the job AI can support, and which aspects need a more delicate hand (and nuanced brain, tbh).Create AI policies and best practices for social mediaMake sure your team and organization are aligned in how you use AI. If you have rules and regulations in place, potential nightmares like angry customers and unapproved posts can be avoided.\xa0\xa0Dig deeper into our AI dataGet the full report →Look into your industry’s futureUnveil new data and industry insights to skyrocket your social ROI in 2024.01.

The Platform TrendStrategic brands commit to their champion social platformsBe where your audience is, they said.But when your audience is everywhere, that’s a tall order—and the average social media user logs into about seven platforms each month. Seven.For brands, maintaining a presence on multiple networks is hard. In fact, it’s such a challenge for organizations, it’s emerged as the top ROI concern for social media.Orgs fear the ROI impact of being on so many platformsWhich of the following issues do you think contribute to your organization’s concern about ROI for social media activities?Respondents\' concerns for social media ROI: 52% - Time/budget on multiple platforms, 35% - Uncertainty in success metrics, 34% - Attribution uncertainty, 33% - Metric-business link, 31% - Social strategy uncertainty, 25% - Rising costs, 19% - High costs, 18% - Short-term impact, 14% - Long-term impact.Sample: 4,281 respondentsSource: Hootsuite Social Trends 2024 Survey So why does it take so much time and energy to be active—and thrive—on several networks?For one, social content needs to be tailored to the unique audiences, lingo, trends, hashtags, word counts, and visual specs of each platform.Also, platforms change constantly. New user and advertising features are released so often that more than half of marketers say it’s difficult to keep up.7is the number of platforms the average social media user logs into each monthSource58%of marketers feel that the pace at which networks release new user and advertising features makes it hard to keep upSourceToday, instead of trying to do everything, everywhere, all at once, and letting time, money, resources, and results fall by the wayside (the historical norm), organizations are actually doing something about it—using ROI to figure out their next moves.Take Twitter/X, for example. The majority (60%) of organizations have a presence there, but only a third of them feel strongly that it benefits their business—which might explain the 7% drop in brand use.So organizations are more willing than even to say buh-bye to platforms and strategies that aren’t meeting their definition of ROI. They’re finally prioritizing their own platform-by-platform ROI scores and making business decisions accordingly.No value, no point: Brands leave some of the social platform giantsChange in platform use for businesses from 2022 to 2023Graph regarding change in platform use for businesses from 2022 to 2023. Results show +16% TikTok, +5% LinkedIn, +1% Instagram, +0% YouTube, +0% Snapchat, -1% Facebook, -7% X (Formerly Twitter), -11% Pinterest, -18% Whatsapp Samples: 3,891 respondents (2024) and 9,422 respondents (2023)Sources: Hootsuite Social Trends 2024 Survey and Hootsuite Social Trends 2023 SurveyIn 2024, strategic organizations will push back against unjustified expectations to be on every platform. They’ll unlock their top-performing channels based on ROI, and focus their attention on those—and only those. If they’re really confident (and brave), they might even abandon one or two altogether.Because mastering a few key platforms is surely better than being so-so at many.How to decode (and declutter) your social platform mixRun a social media audit for platform intelThis will help you identify your hero platforms—and your duds—so you can make informed decisions about how to approach your social strategy moving forward. Get started with our Social Media Audit Guide.Put your platforms in an ROI showdown Calculate the ROI of every platform you use and weigh them against each other. Find a channel that’s lagging behind? Even if it generates a positive ROI, it may not be worth the investment if there’s greater potential for growth with your other platforms.Master the art of (proper) cross-postingWe don’t recommend the copy-and-paste method of cross-posting, but there are ways to do it right. The top rule is to align your content with the norms, best practices, and formats of each platform. Check out this strategy guide for some cross-posting pro tips.Brands like yours are making bold moves on socialSee how they do it, and find all the advice (and confidence) you need to follow suit.Get the full report3. The ROI TrendEntertainment fuels the social ROI engineBefore you quit reading, we get it. Entertainment can be an intimidating word, especially if you work in a “serious” organization (let alone a regulated industry). Can you even connect entertainment to something quantifiable, like ROI?\xa0But consumers are saying it loud and clear. After staying in touch with family and friends, the top reason they use social media is to be entertained and to mentally unwind, according to our Social Trends 2024 Survey.You know what else they said? That they don’t like it when brands are too focused on self-promotion.\xa034%of consumers say “too much self-promotion” is a major turn-off in how they perceive brands on socialSource56%of consumers think that brands should be more relatable on socialSourceThe problem is, brands seem to have other ideas: Almost half of marketers publish product or brand updates or news multiple times a week, according to our survey. That’s a huge disconnect between what brands are posting and what people really want to see.\xa0And it gets worse.While organizations are yammering about themselves, they also use engagement as the top metric to demonstrate ROI.48%of marketers publish product or brand updates multiple times a weekSource68%of marketers report being concerned about the ROI of their social activitiesSourceHow can you demonstrate ROI through engagement metrics when you’re giving the audience exactly what they don’t want to engage with?It’s no surprise then that over two-thirds of social marketers report being concerned about the ROI of their social activities. When brands measure success in ways that don’t add up, ROI will be hard to come by.Brands cling to engagement to demonstrate ROIWhich metrics does your organization most commonly use to demonstrate the return on investment of its social activities?In response to the question "Which metrics does your organization most commonly use to demonstrate the return on investment of its social activities?": 69% engagement, 51% impressions.views, 49% followers, 43% clicks/traffic, 21% leads, 14% sales/revenue, 4% time spent on site/app, 3% sentiment, 3% share of voice, 2% pipeline, 2% survey-based brand awareness.Sample: 4,268 respondentsSource: Hootsuite Social Trends 2024 SurveyIn 2024, brands that publish entertaining content on social will succeed in winning eyeballs, engagement, and (eventually) market share away from brands that keep on publishing the same old stuff.You don’t need to overthink it either. “Entertainment” simply boils down to providing enjoyment, according to the Oxford English Dictionary—that could be finding inspiration, getting excited, feeling moved, or learning something new.Be your relatable person-self, not your super-serious-brand-self. After all, social media is not a place where you talk at someone. It’s an interactive space where the exchange of value is a two-way street.This isn’t a strategy you can pivot to overnight (obvs). But if your old, promotion-heavy strategy isn’t working as well as it used to, it’s time to get back to the true strength of social media: building brand awareness, affinity, and long-term relationships with your audience through engaging, entertaining social content.\u2028How entertainment helps you win socialWhen it comes to content, follow your audience’s leadDon’t assume you know what your followers want to see. Grab the opportunity to ask them what they want through polls and Q&As. You can also run experiments with new content types or tone of voice. Once you see results, start tweaking future posts and keep testing and iterating as you go.\u2028Let social be the long gameDon’t rush into “smashing those goals.” Social is best for building brand equity, which takes time. Don’t revert to your old, self-promotion-y ways either. No one likes a hard sell, and letting them flock to you will be so much more effective in the long run.Make social relationships the foundation of your ROIMeasure how far engagements go beyond social and across your larger business goals. This gives your social media efforts a higher purpose and makes them rooted in customer value and authentic relationships.New industry insights, unveiledEducation TrendsLearn how to make your strategy too cool for schoolRead nowGovernment TrendsLay down the law for your 2024 social strategyRead nowFinancial Services TrendsRead the report for a strategy you can bank onRead nowHealthcare TrendsGive your 2024 social strategy a boost(er)Read nowNonprofit TrendsBuild a social strategy that keeps on givingRead nowGet more insights… or FOMO.

But your brand’s numbers alone aren’t enough to give you a complete picture. You need to stay updated with the latest Instagram statistics to understand industry benchmarks and trends.\nStaying on top of the latest social media stats will help you anticipate changes and fine-tune your strategy accordingly. This is particularly true for a platform like Instagram, which evolves rapidly with new features.\nSo let’s take a look at some of the top Instagram stats that will inform your strategy for 2024.\nTable of contents\n\nInstagram user statistics\nInstagram usage statistics\nInstagram audience and demographics statistics\nInstagram advertising and marketing statistics\nInstagram Stories and Reels statistics\nInstagram for business statistics\nInstagram influencer statistics\nMaking the most of these Instagram stats\n\nInstagram user statistics\nUnderstanding how people perceive and use the platform will help you understand the best way to connect with them. This will help you develop Instagram best practices\xa0to implement in your strategy. These Instagram user statistics can give you a better look:\n1. Almost every Instagram user uses the app alongside other platforms\nAccording to data from Kepios, only\xa00.2% of Instagram users are unique to the platform. A large number of users use it alongside other social media platforms such as Facebook (80.8%), YouTube (77.4%) and TikTok (52.8%). That means having a solid cross-platform marketing strategy is crucial for your brand to succeed.\n2. Posting/sharing photos or videos continues to be the top activity\nIn previous years, people were largely using Instagram to post or share photos and videos. The numbers aren’t changing much in 2024 with the Kepios report showing that 70.4% of users are using the platform for this reason. This indicates a desire for users to be creative and express themselves.\n3. People are seeking entertainment on the platform\nThe same report shows that people are increasingly using the platform for entertainment. Looking for funny or entertaining content was the second most popular activity, with 64.8% of users engaging in it. So brands should get ahead by creating Instagram content that can entertain their audience.\nInstagram usage statistics\nHow popular is Instagram in terms of usage? Let’s take a look at these Instagram usage statistics to find out:\n4. There are 2 billion monthly active users on Instagram\nLatest reports show that Instagram has\xa02 billion monthly active users. While not at the Facebook level (over 3 billion), this is still huge\xa0for brands on Instagram. With the right strategies to get more Instagram followers, these users could turn into loyal fans of your brand.\n\n5. US adults spend 33 minutes per day on the platform\nVideo-based platforms like YouTube and TikTok have become a huge hit among social media users. At the same time, people are still spending a significant amount of time on Instagram. In fact, time spent on Instagram has seen a slight increase in the past year. U.S. adults are spending 33.1 minutes per day on the platform. This is a 3-minute increase from the previous year.\n\nSource: Insider Intelligence\nInstagram audience and demographics statistics\nUnderstanding Instagram’s demographics data gives you an idea of the types of people who use the platform. This helps you assess whether the platform is relevant to your target audience. Here’s a quick breakdown of Instagram statistics related to its audience and demographics.\n6. There are more male than female users\nBased on available data on Instagram users worldwide by gender, there are more male users (51.8%) than female users (48.2%) as of January 2023. The audience is a near even split, meaning the platform isn’t inherently better for reaching one demographic audience over another.\n7. Instagram is most popular among younger audiences\nThe platform sees the highest usage among people\xa0aged between 18 and 34. People within these age groups make up over 60% of Instagram’s user base. As such, the platform is ideal if your target audience consists of young adults and Millennials.\n\nSource: Statista\n8. India and the United States have the greatest number of users\nMuch like other platforms, India leads the way even when it comes to Instagram. The country has\xa0229.5 million Instagram users. The United States comes next with 149.35 million users.\nInstagram advertising and marketing statistics\nAre you getting the most out of your\xa0Instagram advertising\xa0efforts? Is it even worth it to market your brand on Instagram? Here are a few Instagram stats to give you the answers you need.\n9. Instagram ad reach is growing\nAlong with the increase in users, Instagram is offering an increase in ad reach. The Instagram statistics report from Kepios shows a 12.2% year-over-year increase in ad reach. This makes the platform an ideal choice for brands that want to advertise on Instagram.\n10. In-feed ads make up most of the platform’s ad revenue\nOberlo reports that Instagram ad revenue reached $50.58 billion in 2023. Out of this, in-feed ads were a major contributor. Meanwhile, ads on Instagram Stories made up 26.7% of the platform’s ad revenue. In 2024, it’s anticipated that Instagram ad revenue will reach $59.6 billion.\n\n11. Feed ads have a higher click-through rate (CTR) than Stories ads\nA likely explanation for the preference of in-feed ads is the higher click-through rate (CTR)\nBrafton reports that the\xa0CTR for feed ads on Instagram ranges between 0.22% and 0.88%. Meanwhile, Stories ads have a CTR between 0.33% and 0.54%.\nThese numbers suggest that in-feed ads have a higher potential to drive clicks than Stories ads. However, consider experimenting with different ad placements to see which one works best with your audience.\n12. The average cost-per-click (CPC) of Instagram ads is $0.00 – $0.25\nAd costs on Instagram are comparable to other leading platforms like Facebook.\nAccording to a WebFX survey, the CPC for Instagram ads is between $0.00 and $0.25. Impressions cost slightly more, with 46% of companies paying between $0.00 and $4.00 CPM (cost-per-impression) per 1,000 impressions. Meanwhile, you can expect to spend around $0.03 to $0.08 in CPE (cost-per-engagement).\n\nSource: WebFX\n13. Brands see an average conversion rate of 1%\nBazaarvoice found that the average conversion rate for top-performing brands on Instagram was 1%. During this analysis, it discovered a close relationship between reach and conversion rate.\nInterestingly, it’s no longer just the brands with smaller followings that are boasting higher conversions. Brands having up to 100k followers did see higher-than-average conversions compared to last year (1.1% vs. 0.3%). And those with fewer than 10k followers still boast the highest conversion rate (1.3%), but not as much of a lead as last year (2.6%). However, brands having between 500k and 1 million followers had similar conversion rates as past years (0.7%).\n\nSource: Bazaarvoice\nInstagram Stories and Reels statistics\nInstagram offers a wide range of content types to choose from, with Stories and Reels being popular options. Check out these Stories and Reels statistics to see how these formats are performing:\n14. Story reach rate is picking back up\nIn spite of a decline in the previous years, the reach rate for Instagram Stories is finally starting to rise again. According to a RivalQ study, smaller brands with under 10k followers experienced the most significant increase (35%) in Story reach rate. Other groups experienced minor increases while the reach rate for mid-size brands flatlined.\n\nSource: RivalIQ\n15. Retention rate continues to decline with an increase in the number of frames\nThe same Rival IQ study found that the number of frames you post to your Instagram Stories determines how well you retain your audience. After a major dip from the first two frames, the median retention rate remains at 81% by the fourth frame. Story retention rate starts to dip below 75% after the seventh frame.\n16. Short narrative-type Stories are the most popular format\nWhen it comes to the types of Stories that people want to see, short narratives are the most popular. Thirty-five percent of consumers\xa0prefer these types of Stories with a mix of photos, videos and text. Stories with quizzes and polls were another popular option.\nSo if you’re running out of\xa0Instagram Story ideas, use these stats to brainstorm new ideas that engage your audience.\n\nSource: HubSpot\n17. Reels still have the highest reach rate\nSince their introduction, Reels have continued to surpass other content types in terms of reach. A Socialinsider study found that Reels see an average reach rate of 30.81%. That’s double the reach rate of other content formats. Even in terms of impressions, Reels surpass other post types with 2x more impressions.\n\nHowever, this upward trend could soon end as the visibility of Reels experiences a slowdown. The RivalIQ study from earlier found that Reels had the smallest increase in reach compared to other post types.\n18. Reels engagement is dropping\nOn that note, engagement rates for Instagram Reels are starting to drop. The SocialInsider study found a 25% decline in Reels engagement over 2023.\nThat said, the average engagement rate for Instagram Reels still stands at 1.23% per post and it continues to be the most engaging Instagram post type.\n\nSource: SocialInsider\nThe declining numbers in engagement don’t mean brands should stop creating Reels. Rather, it indicates a need to create Reels content that engages your audience. Check out our Instagram Reel ideas guide to create capitvating Reels and keep up with the competition.\nInstagram for business statistics\nSo far, the benefits of Instagram for marketing your business are clear.

Meaning this is where people go to find purchase inspiration and discover new products.\n20. More than half of Instagram users follow/research brands and products\nAlthough people mostly use Instagram to share and consume content, that’s not the only thing they do. The good news for brands is that plenty of users engage with brands on the platform.\nBased on the same Kepios Instagram statistics report above, 62.7% of Instagram users follow or research brands and products on the app. This makes it the third most preferred activity on Instagram, highlighting the platform’s role in informing people’s buying decisions.\nMore importantly, it’s the most used platform for researching and following brands and products compared to all other social media platforms.\nInstagram influencer statistics\nInstagram’s place in the influencer marketing landscape continues to solidify.

Most Instagram influencers are nano influencers\nAccording to Statista, nano influencers having 1,000-10,000 followers make up 65.39% of Instagram influencer accounts. Micro-influencers are the second most popular group making up 27.73% of influencer accounts.\n\nSource: Statista\nThis is great news for brands, especially with the popularity of nano influencer marketing.

Challenges continue to rule on Reels\nTrending challenges embrace a lighter side of social media, and foster a sense of community among Instagram users. Dance challenges, exercise challenges, riddles and other popular tests of strength or smarts are virtually always circulating on the platform: take a scroll through your Reels and you’re sure to come across them.\nFor example, right now there’s a challenge going around where folks ask their friends, family or coworkers to try and jump without bending their knees.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by BuzzFeed (@buzzfeed)\n\n\n\nChallenges can also be posed from the poster to the audience—for instance, in “guess who’s singing” challenges, users can reply in the comments with their guesses.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by A Cappella Academy | 501(c)(3) (@acappellacademy)\n\n\n\nThe “Roman empire” trend could also be considered a challenge, where users ask men in their lives how often they think about the Roman empire…\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lex nicoleta (@lex_nicoleta)\n\n\n\n… with varying results.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Calum Worthy (@calumworthy)\n\n\n\n2. Replying with Reels creates conversations\nInstagram took a note from TikTok and introduced “reply Reels” to give creators and brands more opportunities to meaningfully engage with their audiences. When a user leaves a comment on a public Reel, the poster of the Reel can reply to it with another video, creating a dialogue with the commenter.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mike Archangelo (@mikearchangelo)\n\n\n\nSometimes, reply Reels answer questions or draw attention to positive feedback—the video above is answering a question, and is meant for educational purposes. But it’s also common for users to use Reel replies to respond to negative comments… to clap back, if you will.\n3. AI generates new opportunities\nEek, robots are taking over the world — Instagram included. Many IG users are using AI to generate content ideas, write captions and even edit photos and videos.\nAnd that’s fair game! AI can help you painlessly fill up your content calendar. Just remember: you’re still the brains of the operation. Don’t take AI-generated posts and ideas at face value. Make edits when necessary to make sure that everything that goes live is aligned with your goals and brand guidelines.\nHootsuite, for example, has Owlywriter AI for instant captions, repurposing past content and coming up with fresh campaigns. Sign up for a free 30-day trial to check it out!\n\n4. Photo dumps keep it real\nAn Instagram photo dump is a collection of images posted in a carousel (sidenote: Instagram carousel posts, on average, get three times as much engagement as a single feed photo post does). Photo dumps generally include a variety of different kinds of images and also a variety of image qualities.\nPhoto dumps are evidence of a movement away from the polished, edited, filtered content that Instagram has become known for. Photo dumps are a more casual and honest representation of the way we actually live: blurry photos, messy spaces and screenshots of memes are the usual suspects in a standard dump.\nFor excellent examples of photo dumps, look no further than Gen Z celebrities: they’ve created an art form.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter)\n\n\n\n5. Text posts thrive on the ‘gram\nInstagram is, first and foremost, a photo- and video-sharing app… right? That may be true, but the definition of a photo or video continues to be blurred by social media. Think about collections of memes, or screenshots of Tweets (which are now just called posts, we guess, since Twitter rebranded as X).\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CwgK6PzM-GN/\nGorgeous, high-resolution photos will always be winners on Instagram, but text posts are trending, too. A simple note or relatable screengrab is super sharable, and continues to be a low-maintenance minefield of content.\nPro tip: if you’re posting text-based images on Instagram, make sure you’re making them accessible. Not everyone is able to use vision to take in information, and you want your content to reach as many people as possible. Use the alt text field to type out the words in your post so that everyone can read them.\n6. The future of Threads is uncertain\nThis is in contrast to the point above: while text does well on Instagram, IG’s text-based offshoot isn’t exactly thriving.\nMeta introduced Threads, a text-based “update” app, in summer 2023. Threads uses the same login info as Instagram, meaning that if you already have an IG account, you’ve got a Threads account, too — it’s just waiting for you to sign in.\nWhen it comes down to it, the best way to describe Threads is “like Twitter” or “like X, the app formerly known as Twitter.” It’s certainly intended as a direct competitor. At first, it seemed like threads might actually be the new tweets, but as news outlets report that Threads daily active user numbers are falling, the future isn’t clear.\nThe takeaway? Using Threads is an excellent way to enhance your social presence, but now’s probably not the time to invest all of your resources into that one platform.\n7. Working together with Instagram collab posts\nNot only are Instagram collab posts used as engagement announcements by every annoying person you went to high school with — they’re also super helpful for business partnerships. Instagram collab posts allow for two or more accounts to post the same content and share the likes, comments and other engagement-boosting analytics.\nFor example, take this collab post with Lululemon, Peloton and several influential fitness creators: it has 36 thousand likes and over 800 comments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lululemon (@lululemon)\n\n\n\nPosting in collaboration with another user automatically expands your reach. It gives you the opportunity to be seen by not only your followers, but by your collaborator’s followers as well.\nCollab posts are great for relationship-building (in marketing and in life) and often produce win-win results for both parties.\n8. Driving traffic with a link in bio\nThere’s lots of ways to make money on Instagram, but most of them involve making money indirectly. In other words, Instagram isn’t paying you, it’s just a tool you use to guide consumers towards your business. To actually convert your IG audience into paying customers, you’ll need to use your link in bio.\nTake this post from Bon Appetit, for example. Instead of posting the recipe, the Instagram post is used to direct audiences to the company’s website (which, in turn, directs them to signing up for a paid subscription).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by bonappetitmag (@bonappetitmag)\n\n\n\nCreators use their link in bio to direct followers to their online store or Youtube page, retailers use it to direct people to their ecommerce platform, actors use it to link to upcoming projects. It’s a super-diverse, super-useful part of Instagram, and if you’re not using it, this is your sign.\n9. Music, music everywhere\nYou can’t hear a photo, right? Wrong — at least, that’s not the case on Instagram anymore. Now, you can add audio to your still photos and carousels, which helps to boost how engaging your content is.\nThat means you can now add music to your Reels, Instagram stories and your posts: you can’t stop the beat. As videos become more and more prominent on the platform, creators are looking for ways to make their photos more captivating, and adding music is a free and easy way to boost a still image’s wow-factor.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Universal Music Ireland (@universalmusicireland)\n\n\n\n(Unfortunately, music isn’t actually everywhere—still photos posted with audio can only be heard using Instagram’s mobile app, so if you’re reading this on a computer, the embedded post above won’t look like it has audio. You’ll have to open it on the app to prove it. Alternatively, you can hum a tune yourself.)\n10. Eating around the world\nAccording to Meta’s 2023 Instagram trends report, 68% of Gen Z social media users “will either continue or would like to try food from another culture after discovering it online.”\nFood has always had a huge presence on IG, but modern, younger foodies are more curious and open to trying new foods from other parts of the world.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Maangchi (@maangchi)\n\n\n\nMaangchi’s Korean cooking videos are popular worldwide, and her comments are flooded with folks who are grateful for her lessons on authentic Korean techniques.\n11. Soft launches aren’t just for relationships\nOn Instagram, you may know a “soft launch” as a way for people to hint at a new relationship in their life—rather than showing full commitment by posting a full-face photo of a new partner on their grid, folks are teasing the concept of a new boo by posting blurry or partially hidden pics on their story.\nAnd brands are doing it, too: teasing new products, concepts or services through soft launches on the ‘gram. It’s a way to hype up the news and create some buzz around the brand (similar to how a soft launch of your new boyfriend hopefully will instigate some gossip).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mejuri (@mejuri)\n\n\n\nHere’s an example from jewelry brand Mejuri. The business posted several videos leading up to a sale, and encouraged followers to sign up for a membership to get early access to the deals. Instead of giving away all of the information at once, they’re creating an exclusive opportunity and a bit of mystery.\nTrending Instagram hashtags\nTLDR: Instagram doesn’t publish a list of trending hashtags. So, we had to do some digging.\nThe best Instagram hashtags for you will depend on your specific niche, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for hashtagging on Instagram.\nPlus, using the most popular hashtags doesn’t necessarily mean your post will be successful: #love has been used more than two billion times, meaning that finding a specific post by searching that tag would be basically impossible.\nSo, let’s use an example: say I’m a baker from Vancouver posting some vegan chocolate chip cookies.\nHootsuite has a free hashtag generator to help you come up with ideas—once I type in a description and some keywords…\n\n… some great hashtags are generated for me.\n\nYou can also use the autocomplete on the explore page to come up with ideas–for example, this is what comes up when I start typing “vegan.”\n\nUsing Hootsuite’s social listening technology can also help to identify trending hashtags in your industry (start listening here).\nTrending audio on Instagram\nTrending audio is a little easier to find than trending hashtags, because audio is less niche-specific… but, audio trends change daily. What’s trending on Instagram at the time this post is written might not be trending at the time you’re reading it. So, instead of letting you know what’s’ trending as of the date this blog post is published (it’s “Stick Season”), here are some ways to find what audio is trending, well, now.\nTo find trending audio for an Instagram Reel, open the Instagram Reel editor and tap the music icon. From there, Instagram will show you music it thinks you’ll like. Any song with the “up” arrow next to it is trending upward.\n\nSource: Instagram\nWhen you’re watching Reels, you can also identify if the audio is trending by that arrow—it’s located in the bottom left of the screen.\n\nSource: Instagram\nIf you have more questions about Instagram audio, chances are we’ve answered them here.\nHow to identify and keep up with the latest Instagram trends\nBecause Instagram marketing trends are (literally) always changing and evolving, it’s important to develop strategies to keep up. Here are some hacks for staying in the game.\nRead a social media blog (like Hootsuite)\nWow, genius! You’re already doing it. Hootsuite — and other blogs like it, but come on, we’re the best — keeps up with social trends, conducts social media experiments and gathers useful information all in one spot. Follow social marketing platforms, subscribe to newsletters and check in often.\nFollow Instagram… on Instagram\nAnother no-brainer. Follow Instagram, Meta, and Adam Mosseri on IG, Linkedin, Threads and the platform formerly known as Twitter to stay up to date with new features—new technology often leads to new trends.\nUse the Explore page\nInstagram’s Explore page shows posts that the platform thinks you’ll like, but it’s also a great place to see what topics are on the rise. Just hit the “Search” field and the app will show you a bunch of subjects that are trending. Scroll to the left for more.\nFor example, at the moment this blog post is being written, topics like “pause challenge,” “christmas tree decoration,” “kitchen interior,” “motivational quotes,” “david beckham,” “short hair” and “pedro pascal” are trending.\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\nManage your Instagram presence alongside your other social channels and save time using Hootsuite.

time to post on Instagram. Instagram’s visual nature makes it a desirable marketing platform for brands to get their offerings in front of as many eyes as possible, and knowing the best times to post on Instagram can be a major benefit to your social media strategy.\nRemember: with Instagram as a discovery platform of trends, brands, products or services, it’s important to get high-quality photos and content in front of potential consumers’ eyes at the right time.\nLearn how to identify your best times to post on Instagram with a free trial of Sprout Social and test our ViralPost® feature.\nStart a free Sprout Social trial\nDisclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded globally (not by Central Time), meaning you should be able to publish with the times provided in any timezone and see positive engagement results. Number of engagements represents total engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level engagement times. We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in 2024?\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\n\nWhen are the best times to post Reels on Instagram?\nAre the best times to post on Instagram different for static posts versus Reels? Perhaps there’s a definitive answer to that question, however, our data source is inclusive of posts, Stories and Reels. The information in this article should guide you to uncover the best times to post any content on Instagram to see positive engagement, whether it’s a static post, a Story with polls or a creative Reel.\nThe best times to post Reels on Instagram will be similar to our data above: weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. Our optimal send time data for Instagram is aggregate for Posts, Reels and Stories – both images and videos.\nFor that reason, we recommend you test posting Reels at different times to uncover the highest engagement times for you. Keep in mind that several factors go into Reels’ performance, whether it’s using trending sounds, the Instagram algorithm or having an engaging video hook to capture your audience’s attention.\n\n\nWhat is the best day and time to post on Instagram?\nWe know the best time to post on Instagram overall, but what about for each day of the week? If you’re looking for the best day and time to post on Instagram, read the analysis below.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Monday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Mondays is from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. While there’s decent engagement from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., optimal send and engagement times are those few hours during a typical lunch break.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Tuesday\nThere’s nearly double the highest engagement times on Tuesdays than there are on Mondays. The best time to post on Instagram on Tuesdays is from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Wednesday\nWednesdays see the highest engagement periods than any other day of the week, with even the moderately high engagement times spanning more hours than Tuesdays or Thursdays. The best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Thursday\nSimilar to Wednesdays, the best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and again at 2 p.m. The 1 p.m. hour drops slightly in engagement.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Friday\nBy the time users have reached the weekend, peak engagement hours dip; however, the majority of the workday still captures moderate engagement. Yet the best time to post on Instagram on Fridays is at 11 a.m., but can see almost as much engagement the few hours prior and after that peak engagement time.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Saturday\nGenerally speaking, we’ve noticed that Saturdays and Sundays have less engagement during the rest of the week across most social platforms. Even with Instagram, there’s a significant decrease during the weekends than during weekdays. With that in mind, you’ll still see light to average engagement on the app. The best time to post on Instagram on Saturdays is 9 a.m. to noon, in relation to the rest of the day.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Sunday\nSimilar to Saturdays, we’ve noticed Sundays have less engagement throughout the day across most, if not all, social platforms.

I know, and Sprout Social knows too, but there are still benefits to this data, which could help in your planning.\nSprout’s latest best times to post overview looks at the times where each social app is seeing the most engagement, based on overall trends.\nHere’s a look at the latest data, as it relates to the top social apps, starting with Facebook.\nAccording to Sprout’s data, the best times to post on Facebook are weekdays between 9am and midday, while Sundays are the worst days to post.\n\nAs you can see in the above chart, weekday mornings see more activity, with the 5pm to 6pm period, when people are making their way home, seeing another surge. \nThat’s pretty much the same as what Sprout Social found last year for FB, and while it may seem counterintuitive to be posting early in the workday, that, seemingly, is when more people are logging on and interacting.\nAlso worth noting Sprout’s specific description of its methodology here:\n“We worked closely with Sprout’s Data Science team to review findings and trends in social media usage over the past year from Sprout Social’s more than 34,000 customers and understand when their content was most and least frequently engaged with, broken out by platform and industry.”\nSo it’s based on engagement with posts that came via Sprout Social, not on posting times.\nOn Instagram, Sprout says that weekdays between 9am and 2pm are best, with less engagement on Friday and weekends.\n\nFor LinkedIn, meanwhile, company pages see the most engagement on Tuesdays and Wednesdays between 10am and 12pm. \n\nPinterest is also included, with the best time to Pin being Tuesdays to Fridays at 1am.\n\nYes, 1am. Why so early? \nAccording to Sprout:\n“It may be a combination of when users are struck with inspiration and the Pinterest algorithm that affects engagement times.”\nIn other words, it’s not really clear, but more engagement appears to be happening in the early hours in the app.\nPosting on TikTok works best in the afternoon, from 2pm to 6pm on weekdays.\n\nAs you can see, there are also strong engagement trends between 9am and 11am on Wednesday and Thursday, with other days seeing less engagement.\nFinally, on X, weekdays between 9am and 3pm are best.\n\nAgain, these are just guides, and while they are based on actual engagement rates, individual results will vary. You can use overviews like this to help in your experiments, as you look for the best times to post for your business and audience, and they may help to get you thinking about your strategy, and what could be worth trying out.\nYou can read Sprout Social’s full best times to post report here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlicense\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled Under:\nSocial Marketing, \nFacebook, \nTikTok, \nInstagram, \nPinterest, \nX (Twitter), \nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Today news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\n\n\nEmail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect user consent:\n\n\n\n\n    By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\n    Terms of Use and\n    Privacy Policy.

The first link provides some useful information. It mentions that there are no universal best times to post on social media for every single brand as each brand's audience is different. However, it highlights that the best times to post on Instagram are weekdays between 9am and 2pm, with less engagement on Friday and weekends. Let's now open the second link to gather more data.

That‚Äôs because every brand on social media caters to a unique audience with unique behavior patterns.\nBut don‚Äôt give up hope! There are certain best practices that social media marketers can follow to yield great results across the board.\nThe¬†Instagram algorithm¬†prioritizes recency, so posting when your followers are online is key. This means that, if all else is equal, a newer post will show up higher on the newsfeed than an older one.\nRecency is honestly one of the quickest, easiest wins when it comes to optimizing a post for success. (Though we have plenty more tips on¬†getting free Instagram likes¬†if you‚Äôre interested).\nBut beyond that, it‚Äôs also important to be clear on your goals for your¬†Instagram marketing strategy. Do you have specific targets around building awareness, higher engagement, or driving traffic? What does success look like to you, and when have your posts achieved that success in the past? Your past wins are a key guideline for when you should be posting overall.\n\n\n\n\nBonus: Download a free checklist that reveals the exact steps a fitness influencer used to grow from 0 to 600,000+ followers on Instagram with no budget and no expensive gear.\n\n\n\nOverall best time to post on Instagram for likes, comments and shares\nTo find these results, we analyzed data from over 30,000 Instagram posts from businesses of all sizes. Then, we consulted with our own social team for insights gained from posting to an audience of 170k followers.\n(Drum roll, please‚Ä¶)\nThe universal best time to post on Instagram is 11 AM on Wednesdays.\n\nWe found that Instagram users are the most likely to interact with content during work hours mid-day and mid-week. And that makes sense ‚Äî it is a perfect time to take a break from work or school and do some scrolling. (And liking. And commenting.)\nWeekends are typically the worst days to post and don‚Äôt tend to have much Instagram engagement. We suspect that‚Äôs because people are out and about in the real world instead of scrolling Instagram.\nPlanning on posting more than once a week? Here‚Äôs a breakdown of¬†the best times to post on Instagram for each day of the week.\n(Oh, and don‚Äôt forget: the top times shown below are recorded in US Pacific Time)\n\n\n\nDay of the WeekTime\n\n\n\n\nMonday12:00 PM\n\n\nTuesday9:00 AM\n\n\nWednesday11:00 AM\n\n\nThursday11:00 AM\n\n\nFriday2:00 PM\n\n\nSaturday9:00 AM\n\n\nSunday7:00 PM\n\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre just starting off on Instagram and don‚Äôt have a lot of past data or audience insights to work with, try posting around these peak times.\nAs your account grows, we recommend tweaking your posting schedule to fit your specific audience‚Äôs activity patterns.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYour social strategy.

It seems most Instagrammers may like to start their week off strong at work. By lunchtime, they‚Äôre looking to their Instagram feeds for a break.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Tuesday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Tuesday is 9:00 AM. Engagement is also strong earlier in the morning, between 8-10 AM, but peaks around 9:00 AM.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Wednesday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Wednesday is 11:00 AM. Wednesday is also the day that accounts seem to get the highest engagement overall.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Thursday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Thursday is 12:00 PM. In general, the 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM stretch is good for high engagement on any weekday.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Friday\n2:00 PM is the best time to post on Instagram on Friday. Friday engagement is consistent throughout the morning and lunch hour, from 7 AM to 2:00 PM.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Saturday\n9:00 AM is the best time to post on Instagram on Saturday. Grab those eyeballs before people get into their offline weekend plans!\nBest time to post on Instagram on Sunday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Sunday is 7:00 PM. Engagement on Sundays is pretty consistent throughout the afternoon and evening. It remains steady from 12:00 PM to 8:00 PM.\nBest time to post Reels on Instagram\nIf you‚Äôre looking to grow your Instagram followers¬†and¬†engagement, posting Reels at any time of day is a no-brainer. Our data shows that Reels can get up to 300% more engagement than regular Instagram videos.\nAt Hootsuite, we‚Äôve been posting Reels to our Instagram audience of 170k followers for over two years. Over that time, we‚Äôve learned that the best post time for Instagram Reels is 9 AM and 12 PM, Monday to Thursday.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Hootsuite \uf8ffü¶â (@hootsuite)\n\n\n\nHow we found the best times to post on Instagram for our account\nHere‚Äôs how we go about finding Hootsuite‚Äôs perfect Instagram posting times.\n(Psstt: If you don‚Äôt feel like reading, you can watch our video for the answer and the tips!)\n\nBrayden Cohen, Hootsuite‚Äôs Social Marketing and Employee Advocacy Strategist, told us:\n‚ÄúTypically, we like to post early in the morning and mid-afternoon. For Instagram, that means we try to post anytime between 8 AM ‚Äì 12 PM PST or 4-5 PM PST on weekdays.‚Äù\nOur Instagram posts ‚Äî for Hootsuite‚Äôs North American B2B audience ‚Äî do best when we hit the early morning or lunch-time hours for our Pacific time zone audience and the sitting-down-to-work or logging-off hours in the Eastern time zone.\n(Remember, that‚Äôs just what works for us. Prime time for businesses in different industries and different time zones may be very different.)\nUsing the activity heatmap provided in Hootsuite Analytics, it‚Äôs easy to see when Hootsuite‚Äôs Instagram audience is online:\n\nSource: Hootsuite Analytics \nCohen and the social team also use the tools in¬†Hootsuite Advanced Analytics to review post performance. ‚ÄúThe data there tells us if we should continue focusing on the same strategy or pivot anything going forward.‚Äù\nOverall, Cohen says that deciding a good time to post on Instagram goes something like this:\n‚ÄúWe use past performance as the guiding star and then review when the audience is online as a second opinion. If our content isn‚Äôt performing well after that, we‚Äôll test different times to see if that changes the post performance.‚Äù\nIn the end, an Instagram¬†content calendar¬†should be as data-driven as the rest of your marketing strategy.\nAnd since the big picture matters, too, here are some key Instagram statistics, benchmarks, and demographics to help you strategize:\n\nBusinesses post to their feeds an average of 1x per day\nThe average engagement rate for a post from a business account is 0.96% \nPeople spend roughly¬†30 minutes on Instagram every day\nEach visit to the platform lasts about 6 minutes and 35 seconds\n63% of American users check Instagram at least once per day\n42% of American users check Instagram several times per day\n\nTips for finding your best time to post on Instagram today\nReview your top-performing posts\nFirst, consider what kind of performance you‚Äôre aiming for: brand awareness or engagement. Your approach to scheduling your Instagram posts might vary depending on your goals.\nIn the past, which of your posts have earned high impressions? When did you post them? And are these posts different from the ones earning likes? What do the numbers tell you about your most compelling content?\nYour¬†Instagram insights and analytics¬†are your best source of truth here. Not all analytics tools are born equal, though. Some social media management tools can help you avoid the heavy data crunching.\n\nTry It Free\nHootsuite‚Äôs Best Time to Publish¬†feature suggests the best times and days of the week to post to Instagram based on your historical performance. It analyzes your social media posts from the past 30 days, then calculates the average impressions or engagement rate by day and hour. Then, you can select optimal time slots for your account based on your performance goals.\nCheck when your audience is most active online\nNext, look at your analytics to determine when your followers are scrolling their feed.\nAs marketers, we need to¬†know our audiences. If you‚Äôre targeting college sports fans on Instagram, their social media usage might be wildly different from tech executives waking up at 4 AM.\n\nHootsuite‚Äôs¬†Best Time to Publish¬†feature will break down this information automatically into a heatmap (see above). It also helps you experiment by predicting specific time slots when your Instagram followers are online.\nIf you want to test new tactics, it will also suggest good time slots you haven‚Äôt used in the last 30 days.\nConsider when your competitors are posting\nDepending on your industry, your competitors may be doing some of the same calculations and experiments that you are.¬†Social listening¬†(or even a full¬†social competitive analysis) can help you keep an eye on what‚Äôs working for others.\nPro Tip: Many brands post on the hour mark. Avoid the competition by posting a few minutes before or after the :00.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t#1 Social Media Tool\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCreate. Schedule. Publish. Engage. Measure. Win.\nFree 30-Day Trial\n\n\n\nPost in your audience‚Äôs time zone\nIf you have a global audience or are based outside of the ‚Äúusual‚Äù time zones, your prime time to post may well turn out to be 3 AM.\nRather than setting some truly cruel alarms, may we suggest automating your Instagram posts? An¬†Instagram scheduler¬†can help you make sure your posts are going up at the right time, day in and day out. \nHere‚Äôs a quick overview of how to schedule posts using Hootsuite‚Äôs Instagram scheduling feature:\nhttps://youtu.be/t8H9RoCKG7s\nMonitor and adjust\nYes, optimizing your Instagram posts for success takes a lot of work ‚Äî it‚Äôs a lot more than just choosing the right filter.\nBut taking time to review the numbers is actually one of the easiest ways to improve your reach. (Easier than leveling up your videography or writing skills, anyway. We‚Äôd recommend doing that too, though!)\nAccording to Brayden Cohen from Hootsuite‚Äôs Instagram team: ‚ÄúWe look at our top-performing posts weekly to see if there are any insights that will help us rework our social media strategy or posting cadence. But we generally only change the times we post once a quarter, if that.‚Äù\nCohen noted that, for example, with the pandemic‚Äôs effect on work schedules in 2020, many people spent less time commuting or enjoying a traditional lunch break. As a result, B2B audiences began spending more time on their phones, and Instagram usage started to spread out over the day.\nThe world changes and audience habits change with it. Set a reminder in your calendar to review your results and make adjustments on a regular basis.\nShow up consistently over the long term\nIt‚Äôs important to be systematic about your posting to reap the full rewards of all this knowledge about your target audience. Sure, you may not see a jaw-dropping bump just by posting a few hours earlier than usual every now and then. But as our data shows, the timing of your Instagram posts does matter, and consistent scheduling will move the needle over time.\nWhen your audience gets in the habit of seeing your brand pop up on their feed, they enjoy your content, and they engage with it. Maintaining your presence on Instagram helps build credibility, trust, and more meaningful relationships with your audience.\nAt the end of the day, when you have an authentic connection with your audience, Instagram‚Äôs algorithm notices, and so does your bottom line.\nFrequently asked questions about the best time to post on Instagram\nWhat time of day is Instagram most active?\nIn Hootsuite‚Äôs own research, we found that Instagram users are the most likely to interact with content during work hours, mid-day and mid-week.\nIs it better to post on Instagram at night or during the day?\nWe‚Äôve found that posting on Instagram during the day is best for maximizing reach and engagement.\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram?\nAccording to our research, the universal best time to post on Instagram is 11 AM on Wednesdays.\nHow do you check the best time to post on Instagram?\nReviewing your audience‚Äôs behavior is the best way to find a good time to post on Instagram. Open your Instagram app and go to Insights, then Audience. It will show you approximate times each day of the week that your followers are the most active on Instagram.\nYou can also use Hootsuite‚Äôs¬†Best Time to Publish¬†feature, which suggests the best times and days of the week to post to Instagram based on your historical performance.

So instead of covering specific trends that might be out of date by the time we finish typing this sentence, we’re going to cover broader trends and cite some current examples.\n\n\n\n\nGet our 2024 Social Trends report, and dig into the juicy data that’ll help you reach your goals in 2024—which is shaping up to be social’s best year yet.\n\n\n\n11 most important 2024 Instagram trends\n1. Challenges continue to rule on Reels\nTrending challenges embrace a lighter side of social media, and foster a sense of community among Instagram users. Dance challenges, exercise challenges, riddles and other popular tests of strength or smarts are virtually always circulating on the platform: take a scroll through your Reels and you’re sure to come across them.\nFor example, right now there’s a challenge going around where folks ask their friends, family or coworkers to try and jump without bending their knees.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by BuzzFeed (@buzzfeed)\n\n\n\nChallenges can also be posed from the poster to the audience—for instance, in “guess who’s singing” challenges, users can reply in the comments with their guesses.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by A Cappella Academy | 501(c)(3) (@acappellacademy)\n\n\n\nThe “Roman empire” trend could also be considered a challenge, where users ask men in their lives how often they think about the Roman empire…\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lex nicoleta (@lex_nicoleta)\n\n\n\n… with varying results.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Calum Worthy (@calumworthy)\n\n\n\n2. Replying with Reels creates conversations\nInstagram took a note from TikTok and introduced “reply Reels” to give creators and brands more opportunities to meaningfully engage with their audiences. When a user leaves a comment on a public Reel, the poster of the Reel can reply to it with another video, creating a dialogue with the commenter.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mike Archangelo (@mikearchangelo)\n\n\n\nSometimes, reply Reels answer questions or draw attention to positive feedback—the video above is answering a question, and is meant for educational purposes. But it’s also common for users to use Reel replies to respond to negative comments… to clap back, if you will.\n3. AI generates new opportunities\nEek, robots are taking over the world — Instagram included. Many IG users are using AI to generate content ideas, write captions and even edit photos and videos.\nAnd that’s fair game! AI can help you painlessly fill up your content calendar. Just remember: you’re still the brains of the operation. Don’t take AI-generated posts and ideas at face value. Make edits when necessary to make sure that everything that goes live is aligned with your goals and brand guidelines.\nHootsuite, for example, has Owlywriter AI for instant captions, repurposing past content and coming up with fresh campaigns. Sign up for a free 30-day trial to check it out!\n\n4. Photo dumps keep it real\nAn Instagram photo dump is a collection of images posted in a carousel (sidenote: Instagram carousel posts, on average, get three times as much engagement as a single feed photo post does). Photo dumps generally include a variety of different kinds of images and also a variety of image qualities.\nPhoto dumps are evidence of a movement away from the polished, edited, filtered content that Instagram has become known for. Photo dumps are a more casual and honest representation of the way we actually live: blurry photos, messy spaces and screenshots of memes are the usual suspects in a standard dump.\nFor excellent examples of photo dumps, look no further than Gen Z celebrities: they’ve created an art form.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter)\n\n\n\n5. Text posts thrive on the ‘gram\nInstagram is, first and foremost, a photo- and video-sharing app… right? That may be true, but the definition of a photo or video continues to be blurred by social media. Think about collections of memes, or screenshots of Tweets (which are now just called posts, we guess, since Twitter rebranded as X).\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CwgK6PzM-GN/\nGorgeous, high-resolution photos will always be winners on Instagram, but text posts are trending, too. A simple note or relatable screengrab is super sharable, and continues to be a low-maintenance minefield of content.\nPro tip: if you’re posting text-based images on Instagram, make sure you’re making them accessible. Not everyone is able to use vision to take in information, and you want your content to reach as many people as possible. Use the alt text field to type out the words in your post so that everyone can read them.\n6. The future of Threads is uncertain\nThis is in contrast to the point above: while text does well on Instagram, IG’s text-based offshoot isn’t exactly thriving.\nMeta introduced Threads, a text-based “update” app, in summer 2023. Threads uses the same login info as Instagram, meaning that if you already have an IG account, you’ve got a Threads account, too — it’s just waiting for you to sign in.\nWhen it comes down to it, the best way to describe Threads is “like Twitter” or “like X, the app formerly known as Twitter.” It’s certainly intended as a direct competitor. At first, it seemed like threads might actually be the new tweets, but as news outlets report that Threads daily active user numbers are falling, the future isn’t clear.\nThe takeaway? Using Threads is an excellent way to enhance your social presence, but now’s probably not the time to invest all of your resources into that one platform.\n7. Working together with Instagram collab posts\nNot only are Instagram collab posts used as engagement announcements by every annoying person you went to high school with — they’re also super helpful for business partnerships. Instagram collab posts allow for two or more accounts to post the same content and share the likes, comments and other engagement-boosting analytics.\nFor example, take this collab post with Lululemon, Peloton and several influential fitness creators: it has 36 thousand likes and over 800 comments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lululemon (@lululemon)\n\n\n\nPosting in collaboration with another user automatically expands your reach. It gives you the opportunity to be seen by not only your followers, but by your collaborator’s followers as well.\nCollab posts are great for relationship-building (in marketing and in life) and often produce win-win results for both parties.\n8. Driving traffic with a link in bio\nThere’s lots of ways to make money on Instagram, but most of them involve making money indirectly. In other words, Instagram isn’t paying you, it’s just a tool you use to guide consumers towards your business. To actually convert your IG audience into paying customers, you’ll need to use your link in bio.\nTake this post from Bon Appetit, for example. Instead of posting the recipe, the Instagram post is used to direct audiences to the company’s website (which, in turn, directs them to signing up for a paid subscription).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by bonappetitmag (@bonappetitmag)\n\n\n\nCreators use their link in bio to direct followers to their online store or Youtube page, retailers use it to direct people to their ecommerce platform, actors use it to link to upcoming projects. It’s a super-diverse, super-useful part of Instagram, and if you’re not using it, this is your sign.\n9. Music, music everywhere\nYou can’t hear a photo, right? Wrong — at least, that’s not the case on Instagram anymore. Now, you can add audio to your still photos and carousels, which helps to boost how engaging your content is.\nThat means you can now add music to your Reels, Instagram stories and your posts: you can’t stop the beat. As videos become more and more prominent on the platform, creators are looking for ways to make their photos more captivating, and adding music is a free and easy way to boost a still image’s wow-factor.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Universal Music Ireland (@universalmusicireland)\n\n\n\n(Unfortunately, music isn’t actually everywhere—still photos posted with audio can only be heard using Instagram’s mobile app, so if you’re reading this on a computer, the embedded post above won’t look like it has audio. You’ll have to open it on the app to prove it. Alternatively, you can hum a tune yourself.)\n10. Eating around the world\nAccording to Meta’s 2023 Instagram trends report, 68% of Gen Z social media users “will either continue or would like to try food from another culture after discovering it online.”\nFood has always had a huge presence on IG, but modern, younger foodies are more curious and open to trying new foods from other parts of the world.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Maangchi (@maangchi)\n\n\n\nMaangchi’s Korean cooking videos are popular worldwide, and her comments are flooded with folks who are grateful for her lessons on authentic Korean techniques.\n11. Soft launches aren’t just for relationships\nOn Instagram, you may know a “soft launch” as a way for people to hint at a new relationship in their life—rather than showing full commitment by posting a full-face photo of a new partner on their grid, folks are teasing the concept of a new boo by posting blurry or partially hidden pics on their story.\nAnd brands are doing it, too: teasing new products, concepts or services through soft launches on the ‘gram. It’s a way to hype up the news and create some buzz around the brand (similar to how a soft launch of your new boyfriend hopefully will instigate some gossip).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mejuri (@mejuri)\n\n\n\nHere’s an example from jewelry brand Mejuri. The business posted several videos leading up to a sale, and encouraged followers to sign up for a membership to get early access to the deals. Instead of giving away all of the information at once, they’re creating an exclusive opportunity and a bit of mystery.\nTrending Instagram hashtags\nTLDR: Instagram doesn’t publish a list of trending hashtags. So, we had to do some digging.\nThe best Instagram hashtags for you will depend on your specific niche, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for hashtagging on Instagram.\nPlus, using the most popular hashtags doesn’t necessarily mean your post will be successful: #love has been used more than two billion times, meaning that finding a specific post by searching that tag would be basically impossible.\nSo, let’s use an example: say I’m a baker from Vancouver posting some vegan chocolate chip cookies.\nHootsuite has a free hashtag generator to help you come up with ideas—once I type in a description and some keywords…\n\n… some great hashtags are generated for me.\n\nYou can also use the autocomplete on the explore page to come up with ideas–for example, this is what comes up when I start typing “vegan.”\n\nUsing Hootsuite’s social listening technology can also help to identify trending hashtags in your industry (start listening here).\nTrending audio on Instagram\nTrending audio is a little easier to find than trending hashtags, because audio is less niche-specific… but, audio trends change daily. What’s trending on Instagram at the time this post is written might not be trending at the time you’re reading it. So, instead of letting you know what’s’ trending as of the date this blog post is published (it’s “Stick Season”), here are some ways to find what audio is trending, well, now.\nTo find trending audio for an Instagram Reel, open the Instagram Reel editor and tap the music icon. From there, Instagram will show you music it thinks you’ll like. Any song with the “up” arrow next to it is trending upward.\n\nSource: Instagram\nWhen you’re watching Reels, you can also identify if the audio is trending by that arrow—it’s located in the bottom left of the screen.\n\nSource: Instagram\nIf you have more questions about Instagram audio, chances are we’ve answered them here.\nHow to identify and keep up with the latest Instagram trends\nBecause Instagram marketing trends are (literally) always changing and evolving, it’s important to develop strategies to keep up. Here are some hacks for staying in the game.\nRead a social media blog (like Hootsuite)\nWow, genius! You’re already doing it. Hootsuite — and other blogs like it, but come on, we’re the best — keeps up with social trends, conducts social media experiments and gathers useful information all in one spot. Follow social marketing platforms, subscribe to newsletters and check in often.\nFollow Instagram… on Instagram\nAnother no-brainer. Follow Instagram, Meta, and Adam Mosseri on IG, Linkedin, Threads and the platform formerly known as Twitter to stay up to date with new features—new technology often leads to new trends.\nUse the Explore page\nInstagram’s Explore page shows posts that the platform thinks you’ll like, but it’s also a great place to see what topics are on the rise. Just hit the “Search” field and the app will show you a bunch of subjects that are trending. Scroll to the left for more.\nFor example, at the moment this blog post is being written, topics like “pause challenge,” “christmas tree decoration,” “kitchen interior,” “motivational quotes,” “david beckham,” “short hair” and “pedro pascal” are trending.\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\nManage your Instagram presence alongside your other social channels and save time using Hootsuite.

time to post on Instagram. Instagram’s visual nature makes it a desirable marketing platform for brands to get their offerings in front of as many eyes as possible, and knowing the best times to post on Instagram can be a major benefit to your social media strategy.\nRemember: with Instagram as a discovery platform of trends, brands, products or services, it’s important to get high-quality photos and content in front of potential consumers’ eyes at the right time.\nLearn how to identify your best times to post on Instagram with a free trial of Sprout Social and test our ViralPost® feature.\nStart a free Sprout Social trial\nDisclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded globally (not by Central Time), meaning you should be able to publish with the times provided in any timezone and see positive engagement results. Number of engagements represents total engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level engagement times. We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in 2024?\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\n\nWhen are the best times to post Reels on Instagram?\nAre the best times to post on Instagram different for static posts versus Reels? Perhaps there’s a definitive answer to that question, however, our data source is inclusive of posts, Stories and Reels. The information in this article should guide you to uncover the best times to post any content on Instagram to see positive engagement, whether it’s a static post, a Story with polls or a creative Reel.\nThe best times to post Reels on Instagram will be similar to our data above: weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. Our optimal send time data for Instagram is aggregate for Posts, Reels and Stories – both images and videos.\nFor that reason, we recommend you test posting Reels at different times to uncover the highest engagement times for you. Keep in mind that several factors go into Reels’ performance, whether it’s using trending sounds, the Instagram algorithm or having an engaging video hook to capture your audience’s attention.\n\n\nWhat is the best day and time to post on Instagram?\nWe know the best time to post on Instagram overall, but what about for each day of the week? If you’re looking for the best day and time to post on Instagram, read the analysis below.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Monday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Mondays is from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. While there’s decent engagement from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., optimal send and engagement times are those few hours during a typical lunch break.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Tuesday\nThere’s nearly double the highest engagement times on Tuesdays than there are on Mondays. The best time to post on Instagram on Tuesdays is from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Wednesday\nWednesdays see the highest engagement periods than any other day of the week, with even the moderately high engagement times spanning more hours than Tuesdays or Thursdays. The best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Thursday\nSimilar to Wednesdays, the best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and again at 2 p.m. The 1 p.m. hour drops slightly in engagement.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Friday\nBy the time users have reached the weekend, peak engagement hours dip; however, the majority of the workday still captures moderate engagement. Yet the best time to post on Instagram on Fridays is at 11 a.m., but can see almost as much engagement the few hours prior and after that peak engagement time.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Saturday\nGenerally speaking, we’ve noticed that Saturdays and Sundays have less engagement during the rest of the week across most social platforms. Even with Instagram, there’s a significant decrease during the weekends than during weekdays. With that in mind, you’ll still see light to average engagement on the app. The best time to post on Instagram on Saturdays is 9 a.m. to noon, in relation to the rest of the day.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Sunday\nSimilar to Saturdays, we’ve noticed Sundays have less engagement throughout the day across most, if not all, social platforms. In relation to the day itself, the best time to post on Instagram on Sundays is 10 a.m. to noon.\n\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in the UK?\nThe overall best time to post on Instagram in the UK is weekdays between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Midweek, engagement rates remain high until 4 p.m. Things are noticeably quieter at the weekend across many social platforms, including Instagram in the UK. Taking this into account, the best time to post on Saturday is 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 10 am to 12 p.m. on Sundays. If Instagram is the platform your UK audience engages with most, remember your industry, business goals and content will also play a part in the success of your social posts.\n\n\nWhat are the best times to post on Instagram by industry?\nThere’s no definitive answer to what the best times to post on Instagram are. We can only offer insight with the data we have. Industry is just one factor that plays into the success of your social posts. Consider as well as your target audience, business goals and the content itself.\nUse this industry-level data to help inform your publishing calendar, and test your optimal send times with social experiments.\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for hospitals & healthcare\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare:\n\nMondays at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.\nTuesdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.\nThursdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.\nFridays from 11 a..m. to 3 p.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare: Tuesdays through Fridays\nWorst days to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare: Sundays\n\nHospitals, clinics and healthcare providers use social media for more than navigating healthcare crises.

Mondays through Fridayys see consistent engagement from 10 a.m. until about 6 p.m. However, the hours with the highest engagement and therefore the best time to post on Instagram for schools are Wednesdays from 2 to 4 p.m. and again at 9 p.m.\nFrom highlighting student life to sharing school updates, a social media strategy for schools needs to fulfill various purposes: from engaging with students past, present and future, to keeping a pulse on brand health.\nSchools and education social media resources\n\n15 ways to use social media for education\nUniversity branding: How to build your school’s brand on social media\nHigher ed playbook: Using social to unite your university\n\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for travel & hospitality\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for Travel & Hospitality:\n\nWednesdays from noon to 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.\nSundays from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram for Travel & Hospitality:\n\nWednesdays and Thursdays\n\n\nWorst days to post on Instagram for Travel & Hospitality:\n\nNone; all days receive moderate engagement\n\n\n\nTravel and hospitality industries once again doubled their engagement on Instagram relative to last year.

Challenges continue to rule on Reels\nTrending challenges embrace a lighter side of social media, and foster a sense of community among Instagram users. Dance challenges, exercise challenges, riddles and other popular tests of strength or smarts are virtually always circulating on the platform: take a scroll through your Reels and you’re sure to come across them.\nFor example, right now there’s a challenge going around where folks ask their friends, family or coworkers to try and jump without bending their knees.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by BuzzFeed (@buzzfeed)\n\n\n\nChallenges can also be posed from the poster to the audience—for instance, in “guess who’s singing” challenges, users can reply in the comments with their guesses.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by A Cappella Academy | 501(c)(3) (@acappellacademy)\n\n\n\nThe “Roman empire” trend could also be considered a challenge, where users ask men in their lives how often they think about the Roman empire…\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lex nicoleta (@lex_nicoleta)\n\n\n\n… with varying results.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Calum Worthy (@calumworthy)\n\n\n\n2. Replying with Reels creates conversations\nInstagram took a note from TikTok and introduced “reply Reels” to give creators and brands more opportunities to meaningfully engage with their audiences. When a user leaves a comment on a public Reel, the poster of the Reel can reply to it with another video, creating a dialogue with the commenter.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mike Archangelo (@mikearchangelo)\n\n\n\nSometimes, reply Reels answer questions or draw attention to positive feedback—the video above is answering a question, and is meant for educational purposes. But it’s also common for users to use Reel replies to respond to negative comments… to clap back, if you will.\n3. AI generates new opportunities\nEek, robots are taking over the world — Instagram included. Many IG users are using AI to generate content ideas, write captions and even edit photos and videos.\nAnd that’s fair game! AI can help you painlessly fill up your content calendar. Just remember: you’re still the brains of the operation. Don’t take AI-generated posts and ideas at face value. Make edits when necessary to make sure that everything that goes live is aligned with your goals and brand guidelines.\nHootsuite, for example, has Owlywriter AI for instant captions, repurposing past content and coming up with fresh campaigns. Sign up for a free 30-day trial to check it out!\n\n4. Photo dumps keep it real\nAn Instagram photo dump is a collection of images posted in a carousel (sidenote: Instagram carousel posts, on average, get three times as much engagement as a single feed photo post does). Photo dumps generally include a variety of different kinds of images and also a variety of image qualities.\nPhoto dumps are evidence of a movement away from the polished, edited, filtered content that Instagram has become known for. Photo dumps are a more casual and honest representation of the way we actually live: blurry photos, messy spaces and screenshots of memes are the usual suspects in a standard dump.\nFor excellent examples of photo dumps, look no further than Gen Z celebrities: they’ve created an art form.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter)\n\n\n\n5. Text posts thrive on the ‘gram\nInstagram is, first and foremost, a photo- and video-sharing app… right? That may be true, but the definition of a photo or video continues to be blurred by social media. Think about collections of memes, or screenshots of Tweets (which are now just called posts, we guess, since Twitter rebranded as X).\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CwgK6PzM-GN/\nGorgeous, high-resolution photos will always be winners on Instagram, but text posts are trending, too. A simple note or relatable screengrab is super sharable, and continues to be a low-maintenance minefield of content.\nPro tip: if you’re posting text-based images on Instagram, make sure you’re making them accessible. Not everyone is able to use vision to take in information, and you want your content to reach as many people as possible. Use the alt text field to type out the words in your post so that everyone can read them.\n6. The future of Threads is uncertain\nThis is in contrast to the point above: while text does well on Instagram, IG’s text-based offshoot isn’t exactly thriving.\nMeta introduced Threads, a text-based “update” app, in summer 2023. Threads uses the same login info as Instagram, meaning that if you already have an IG account, you’ve got a Threads account, too — it’s just waiting for you to sign in.\nWhen it comes down to it, the best way to describe Threads is “like Twitter” or “like X, the app formerly known as Twitter.” It’s certainly intended as a direct competitor. At first, it seemed like threads might actually be the new tweets, but as news outlets report that Threads daily active user numbers are falling, the future isn’t clear.\nThe takeaway? Using Threads is an excellent way to enhance your social presence, but now’s probably not the time to invest all of your resources into that one platform.\n7. Working together with Instagram collab posts\nNot only are Instagram collab posts used as engagement announcements by every annoying person you went to high school with — they’re also super helpful for business partnerships. Instagram collab posts allow for two or more accounts to post the same content and share the likes, comments and other engagement-boosting analytics.\nFor example, take this collab post with Lululemon, Peloton and several influential fitness creators: it has 36 thousand likes and over 800 comments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lululemon (@lululemon)\n\n\n\nPosting in collaboration with another user automatically expands your reach. It gives you the opportunity to be seen by not only your followers, but by your collaborator’s followers as well.\nCollab posts are great for relationship-building (in marketing and in life) and often produce win-win results for both parties.\n8. Driving traffic with a link in bio\nThere’s lots of ways to make money on Instagram, but most of them involve making money indirectly. In other words, Instagram isn’t paying you, it’s just a tool you use to guide consumers towards your business. To actually convert your IG audience into paying customers, you’ll need to use your link in bio.\nTake this post from Bon Appetit, for example. Instead of posting the recipe, the Instagram post is used to direct audiences to the company’s website (which, in turn, directs them to signing up for a paid subscription).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by bonappetitmag (@bonappetitmag)\n\n\n\nCreators use their link in bio to direct followers to their online store or Youtube page, retailers use it to direct people to their ecommerce platform, actors use it to link to upcoming projects. It’s a super-diverse, super-useful part of Instagram, and if you’re not using it, this is your sign.\n9. Music, music everywhere\nYou can’t hear a photo, right? Wrong — at least, that’s not the case on Instagram anymore. Now, you can add audio to your still photos and carousels, which helps to boost how engaging your content is.\nThat means you can now add music to your Reels, Instagram stories and your posts: you can’t stop the beat. As videos become more and more prominent on the platform, creators are looking for ways to make their photos more captivating, and adding music is a free and easy way to boost a still image’s wow-factor.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Universal Music Ireland (@universalmusicireland)\n\n\n\n(Unfortunately, music isn’t actually everywhere—still photos posted with audio can only be heard using Instagram’s mobile app, so if you’re reading this on a computer, the embedded post above won’t look like it has audio. You’ll have to open it on the app to prove it. Alternatively, you can hum a tune yourself.)\n10. Eating around the world\nAccording to Meta’s 2023 Instagram trends report, 68% of Gen Z social media users “will either continue or would like to try food from another culture after discovering it online.”\nFood has always had a huge presence on IG, but modern, younger foodies are more curious and open to trying new foods from other parts of the world.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Maangchi (@maangchi)\n\n\n\nMaangchi’s Korean cooking videos are popular worldwide, and her comments are flooded with folks who are grateful for her lessons on authentic Korean techniques.\n11. Soft launches aren’t just for relationships\nOn Instagram, you may know a “soft launch” as a way for people to hint at a new relationship in their life—rather than showing full commitment by posting a full-face photo of a new partner on their grid, folks are teasing the concept of a new boo by posting blurry or partially hidden pics on their story.\nAnd brands are doing it, too: teasing new products, concepts or services through soft launches on the ‘gram. It’s a way to hype up the news and create some buzz around the brand (similar to how a soft launch of your new boyfriend hopefully will instigate some gossip).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mejuri (@mejuri)\n\n\n\nHere’s an example from jewelry brand Mejuri. The business posted several videos leading up to a sale, and encouraged followers to sign up for a membership to get early access to the deals. Instead of giving away all of the information at once, they’re creating an exclusive opportunity and a bit of mystery.\nTrending Instagram hashtags\nTLDR: Instagram doesn’t publish a list of trending hashtags. So, we had to do some digging.\nThe best Instagram hashtags for you will depend on your specific niche, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for hashtagging on Instagram.\nPlus, using the most popular hashtags doesn’t necessarily mean your post will be successful: #love has been used more than two billion times, meaning that finding a specific post by searching that tag would be basically impossible.\nSo, let’s use an example: say I’m a baker from Vancouver posting some vegan chocolate chip cookies.\nHootsuite has a free hashtag generator to help you come up with ideas—once I type in a description and some keywords…\n\n… some great hashtags are generated for me.\n\nYou can also use the autocomplete on the explore page to come up with ideas–for example, this is what comes up when I start typing “vegan.”\n\nUsing Hootsuite’s social listening technology can also help to identify trending hashtags in your industry (start listening here).\nTrending audio on Instagram\nTrending audio is a little easier to find than trending hashtags, because audio is less niche-specific… but, audio trends change daily. What’s trending on Instagram at the time this post is written might not be trending at the time you’re reading it. So, instead of letting you know what’s’ trending as of the date this blog post is published (it’s “Stick Season”), here are some ways to find what audio is trending, well, now.\nTo find trending audio for an Instagram Reel, open the Instagram Reel editor and tap the music icon. From there, Instagram will show you music it thinks you’ll like. Any song with the “up” arrow next to it is trending upward.\n\nSource: Instagram\nWhen you’re watching Reels, you can also identify if the audio is trending by that arrow—it’s located in the bottom left of the screen.\n\nSource: Instagram\nIf you have more questions about Instagram audio, chances are we’ve answered them here.\nHow to identify and keep up with the latest Instagram trends\nBecause Instagram marketing trends are (literally) always changing and evolving, it’s important to develop strategies to keep up. Here are some hacks for staying in the game.\nRead a social media blog (like Hootsuite)\nWow, genius! You’re already doing it. Hootsuite — and other blogs like it, but come on, we’re the best — keeps up with social trends, conducts social media experiments and gathers useful information all in one spot. Follow social marketing platforms, subscribe to newsletters and check in often.\nFollow Instagram… on Instagram\nAnother no-brainer. Follow Instagram, Meta, and Adam Mosseri on IG, Linkedin, Threads and the platform formerly known as Twitter to stay up to date with new features—new technology often leads to new trends.\nUse the Explore page\nInstagram’s Explore page shows posts that the platform thinks you’ll like, but it’s also a great place to see what topics are on the rise. Just hit the “Search” field and the app will show you a bunch of subjects that are trending. Scroll to the left for more.\nFor example, at the moment this blog post is being written, topics like “pause challenge,” “christmas tree decoration,” “kitchen interior,” “motivational quotes,” “david beckham,” “short hair” and “pedro pascal” are trending.\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\nManage your Instagram presence alongside your other social channels and save time using Hootsuite.

time to post on Instagram. Instagram’s visual nature makes it a desirable marketing platform for brands to get their offerings in front of as many eyes as possible, and knowing the best times to post on Instagram can be a major benefit to your social media strategy.\nRemember: with Instagram as a discovery platform of trends, brands, products or services, it’s important to get high-quality photos and content in front of potential consumers’ eyes at the right time.\nLearn how to identify your best times to post on Instagram with a free trial of Sprout Social and test our ViralPost® feature.\nStart a free Sprout Social trial\nDisclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded globally (not by Central Time), meaning you should be able to publish with the times provided in any timezone and see positive engagement results. Number of engagements represents total engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level engagement times. We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in 2024?\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\n\nWhen are the best times to post Reels on Instagram?\nAre the best times to post on Instagram different for static posts versus Reels? Perhaps there’s a definitive answer to that question, however, our data source is inclusive of posts, Stories and Reels. The information in this article should guide you to uncover the best times to post any content on Instagram to see positive engagement, whether it’s a static post, a Story with polls or a creative Reel.\nThe best times to post Reels on Instagram will be similar to our data above: weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. Our optimal send time data for Instagram is aggregate for Posts, Reels and Stories – both images and videos.\nFor that reason, we recommend you test posting Reels at different times to uncover the highest engagement times for you. Keep in mind that several factors go into Reels’ performance, whether it’s using trending sounds, the Instagram algorithm or having an engaging video hook to capture your audience’s attention.\n\n\nWhat is the best day and time to post on Instagram?\nWe know the best time to post on Instagram overall, but what about for each day of the week? If you’re looking for the best day and time to post on Instagram, read the analysis below.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Monday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Mondays is from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. While there’s decent engagement from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., optimal send and engagement times are those few hours during a typical lunch break.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Tuesday\nThere’s nearly double the highest engagement times on Tuesdays than there are on Mondays.

So instead of covering specific trends that might be out of date by the time we finish typing this sentence, we’re going to cover broader trends and cite some current examples.\n\n\n\n\nGet our 2024 Social Trends report, and dig into the juicy data that’ll help you reach your goals in 2024—which is shaping up to be social’s best year yet.\n\n\n\n11 most important 2024 Instagram trends\n1. Challenges continue to rule on Reels\nTrending challenges embrace a lighter side of social media, and foster a sense of community among Instagram users. Dance challenges, exercise challenges, riddles and other popular tests of strength or smarts are virtually always circulating on the platform: take a scroll through your Reels and you’re sure to come across them.\nFor example, right now there’s a challenge going around where folks ask their friends, family or coworkers to try and jump without bending their knees.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by BuzzFeed (@buzzfeed)\n\n\n\nChallenges can also be posed from the poster to the audience—for instance, in “guess who’s singing” challenges, users can reply in the comments with their guesses.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by A Cappella Academy | 501(c)(3) (@acappellacademy)\n\n\n\nThe “Roman empire” trend could also be considered a challenge, where users ask men in their lives how often they think about the Roman empire…\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lex nicoleta (@lex_nicoleta)\n\n\n\n… with varying results.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Calum Worthy (@calumworthy)\n\n\n\n2. Replying with Reels creates conversations\nInstagram took a note from TikTok and introduced “reply Reels” to give creators and brands more opportunities to meaningfully engage with their audiences. When a user leaves a comment on a public Reel, the poster of the Reel can reply to it with another video, creating a dialogue with the commenter.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mike Archangelo (@mikearchangelo)\n\n\n\nSometimes, reply Reels answer questions or draw attention to positive feedback—the video above is answering a question, and is meant for educational purposes. But it’s also common for users to use Reel replies to respond to negative comments… to clap back, if you will.\n3. AI generates new opportunities\nEek, robots are taking over the world — Instagram included. Many IG users are using AI to generate content ideas, write captions and even edit photos and videos.\nAnd that’s fair game! AI can help you painlessly fill up your content calendar. Just remember: you’re still the brains of the operation. Don’t take AI-generated posts and ideas at face value. Make edits when necessary to make sure that everything that goes live is aligned with your goals and brand guidelines.\nHootsuite, for example, has Owlywriter AI for instant captions, repurposing past content and coming up with fresh campaigns. Sign up for a free 30-day trial to check it out!\n\n4. Photo dumps keep it real\nAn Instagram photo dump is a collection of images posted in a carousel (sidenote: Instagram carousel posts, on average, get three times as much engagement as a single feed photo post does). Photo dumps generally include a variety of different kinds of images and also a variety of image qualities.\nPhoto dumps are evidence of a movement away from the polished, edited, filtered content that Instagram has become known for. Photo dumps are a more casual and honest representation of the way we actually live: blurry photos, messy spaces and screenshots of memes are the usual suspects in a standard dump.\nFor excellent examples of photo dumps, look no further than Gen Z celebrities: they’ve created an art form.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter)\n\n\n\n5. Text posts thrive on the ‘gram\nInstagram is, first and foremost, a photo- and video-sharing app… right? That may be true, but the definition of a photo or video continues to be blurred by social media. Think about collections of memes, or screenshots of Tweets (which are now just called posts, we guess, since Twitter rebranded as X).\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CwgK6PzM-GN/\nGorgeous, high-resolution photos will always be winners on Instagram, but text posts are trending, too. A simple note or relatable screengrab is super sharable, and continues to be a low-maintenance minefield of content.\nPro tip: if you’re posting text-based images on Instagram, make sure you’re making them accessible. Not everyone is able to use vision to take in information, and you want your content to reach as many people as possible. Use the alt text field to type out the words in your post so that everyone can read them.\n6. The future of Threads is uncertain\nThis is in contrast to the point above: while text does well on Instagram, IG’s text-based offshoot isn’t exactly thriving.\nMeta introduced Threads, a text-based “update” app, in summer 2023. Threads uses the same login info as Instagram, meaning that if you already have an IG account, you’ve got a Threads account, too — it’s just waiting for you to sign in.\nWhen it comes down to it, the best way to describe Threads is “like Twitter” or “like X, the app formerly known as Twitter.” It’s certainly intended as a direct competitor. At first, it seemed like threads might actually be the new tweets, but as news outlets report that Threads daily active user numbers are falling, the future isn’t clear.\nThe takeaway? Using Threads is an excellent way to enhance your social presence, but now’s probably not the time to invest all of your resources into that one platform.\n7. Working together with Instagram collab posts\nNot only are Instagram collab posts used as engagement announcements by every annoying person you went to high school with — they’re also super helpful for business partnerships. Instagram collab posts allow for two or more accounts to post the same content and share the likes, comments and other engagement-boosting analytics.\nFor example, take this collab post with Lululemon, Peloton and several influential fitness creators: it has 36 thousand likes and over 800 comments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lululemon (@lululemon)\n\n\n\nPosting in collaboration with another user automatically expands your reach. It gives you the opportunity to be seen by not only your followers, but by your collaborator’s followers as well.\nCollab posts are great for relationship-building (in marketing and in life) and often produce win-win results for both parties.\n8. Driving traffic with a link in bio\nThere’s lots of ways to make money on Instagram, but most of them involve making money indirectly. In other words, Instagram isn’t paying you, it’s just a tool you use to guide consumers towards your business. To actually convert your IG audience into paying customers, you’ll need to use your link in bio.\nTake this post from Bon Appetit, for example. Instead of posting the recipe, the Instagram post is used to direct audiences to the company’s website (which, in turn, directs them to signing up for a paid subscription).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by bonappetitmag (@bonappetitmag)\n\n\n\nCreators use their link in bio to direct followers to their online store or Youtube page, retailers use it to direct people to their ecommerce platform, actors use it to link to upcoming projects. It’s a super-diverse, super-useful part of Instagram, and if you’re not using it, this is your sign.\n9. Music, music everywhere\nYou can’t hear a photo, right? Wrong — at least, that’s not the case on Instagram anymore. Now, you can add audio to your still photos and carousels, which helps to boost how engaging your content is.\nThat means you can now add music to your Reels, Instagram stories and your posts: you can’t stop the beat. As videos become more and more prominent on the platform, creators are looking for ways to make their photos more captivating, and adding music is a free and easy way to boost a still image’s wow-factor.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Universal Music Ireland (@universalmusicireland)\n\n\n\n(Unfortunately, music isn’t actually everywhere—still photos posted with audio can only be heard using Instagram’s mobile app, so if you’re reading this on a computer, the embedded post above won’t look like it has audio. You’ll have to open it on the app to prove it. Alternatively, you can hum a tune yourself.)\n10. Eating around the world\nAccording to Meta’s 2023 Instagram trends report, 68% of Gen Z social media users “will either continue or would like to try food from another culture after discovering it online.”\nFood has always had a huge presence on IG, but modern, younger foodies are more curious and open to trying new foods from other parts of the world.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Maangchi (@maangchi)\n\n\n\nMaangchi’s Korean cooking videos are popular worldwide, and her comments are flooded with folks who are grateful for her lessons on authentic Korean techniques.\n11. Soft launches aren’t just for relationships\nOn Instagram, you may know a “soft launch” as a way for people to hint at a new relationship in their life—rather than showing full commitment by posting a full-face photo of a new partner on their grid, folks are teasing the concept of a new boo by posting blurry or partially hidden pics on their story.\nAnd brands are doing it, too: teasing new products, concepts or services through soft launches on the ‘gram. It’s a way to hype up the news and create some buzz around the brand (similar to how a soft launch of your new boyfriend hopefully will instigate some gossip).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mejuri (@mejuri)\n\n\n\nHere’s an example from jewelry brand Mejuri. The business posted several videos leading up to a sale, and encouraged followers to sign up for a membership to get early access to the deals. Instead of giving away all of the information at once, they’re creating an exclusive opportunity and a bit of mystery.\nTrending Instagram hashtags\nTLDR: Instagram doesn’t publish a list of trending hashtags. So, we had to do some digging.\nThe best Instagram hashtags for you will depend on your specific niche, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for hashtagging on Instagram.\nPlus, using the most popular hashtags doesn’t necessarily mean your post will be successful: #love has been used more than two billion times, meaning that finding a specific post by searching that tag would be basically impossible.\nSo, let’s use an example: say I’m a baker from Vancouver posting some vegan chocolate chip cookies.\nHootsuite has a free hashtag generator to help you come up with ideas—once I type in a description and some keywords…\n\n… some great hashtags are generated for me.\n\nYou can also use the autocomplete on the explore page to come up with ideas–for example, this is what comes up when I start typing “vegan.”\n\nUsing Hootsuite’s social listening technology can also help to identify trending hashtags in your industry (start listening here).\nTrending audio on Instagram\nTrending audio is a little easier to find than trending hashtags, because audio is less niche-specific… but, audio trends change daily. What’s trending on Instagram at the time this post is written might not be trending at the time you’re reading it. So, instead of letting you know what’s’ trending as of the date this blog post is published (it’s “Stick Season”), here are some ways to find what audio is trending, well, now.\nTo find trending audio for an Instagram Reel, open the Instagram Reel editor and tap the music icon. From there, Instagram will show you music it thinks you’ll like. Any song with the “up” arrow next to it is trending upward.\n\nSource: Instagram\nWhen you’re watching Reels, you can also identify if the audio is trending by that arrow—it’s located in the bottom left of the screen.\n\nSource: Instagram\nIf you have more questions about Instagram audio, chances are we’ve answered them here.\nHow to identify and keep up with the latest Instagram trends\nBecause Instagram marketing trends are (literally) always changing and evolving, it’s important to develop strategies to keep up. Here are some hacks for staying in the game.\nRead a social media blog (like Hootsuite)\nWow, genius! You’re already doing it. Hootsuite — and other blogs like it, but come on, we’re the best — keeps up with social trends, conducts social media experiments and gathers useful information all in one spot. Follow social marketing platforms, subscribe to newsletters and check in often.\nFollow Instagram… on Instagram\nAnother no-brainer. Follow Instagram, Meta, and Adam Mosseri on IG, Linkedin, Threads and the platform formerly known as Twitter to stay up to date with new features—new technology often leads to new trends.\nUse the Explore page\nInstagram’s Explore page shows posts that the platform thinks you’ll like, but it’s also a great place to see what topics are on the rise. Just hit the “Search” field and the app will show you a bunch of subjects that are trending. Scroll to the left for more.\nFor example, at the moment this blog post is being written, topics like “pause challenge,” “christmas tree decoration,” “kitchen interior,” “motivational quotes,” “david beckham,” “short hair” and “pedro pascal” are trending.\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\nManage your Instagram presence alongside your other social channels and save time using Hootsuite.

time to post on Instagram. Instagram’s visual nature makes it a desirable marketing platform for brands to get their offerings in front of as many eyes as possible, and knowing the best times to post on Instagram can be a major benefit to your social media strategy.\nRemember: with Instagram as a discovery platform of trends, brands, products or services, it’s important to get high-quality photos and content in front of potential consumers’ eyes at the right time.\nLearn how to identify your best times to post on Instagram with a free trial of Sprout Social and test our ViralPost® feature.\nStart a free Sprout Social trial\nDisclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded globally (not by Central Time), meaning you should be able to publish with the times provided in any timezone and see positive engagement results. Number of engagements represents total engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level engagement times. We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in 2024?\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\n\nWhen are the best times to post Reels on Instagram?\nAre the best times to post on Instagram different for static posts versus Reels? Perhaps there’s a definitive answer to that question, however, our data source is inclusive of posts, Stories and Reels. The information in this article should guide you to uncover the best times to post any content on Instagram to see positive engagement, whether it’s a static post, a Story with polls or a creative Reel.\nThe best times to post Reels on Instagram will be similar to our data above: weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. Our optimal send time data for Instagram is aggregate for Posts, Reels and Stories – both images and videos.\nFor that reason, we recommend you test posting Reels at different times to uncover the highest engagement times for you. Keep in mind that several factors go into Reels’ performance, whether it’s using trending sounds, the Instagram algorithm or having an engaging video hook to capture your audience’s attention.\n\n\nWhat is the best day and time to post on Instagram?\nWe know the best time to post on Instagram overall, but what about for each day of the week? If you’re looking for the best day and time to post on Instagram, read the analysis below.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Monday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Mondays is from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. While there’s decent engagement from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., optimal send and engagement times are those few hours during a typical lunch break.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Tuesday\nThere’s nearly double the highest engagement times on Tuesdays than there are on Mondays. The best time to post on Instagram on Tuesdays is from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Wednesday\nWednesdays see the highest engagement periods than any other day of the week, with even the moderately high engagement times spanning more hours than Tuesdays or Thursdays. The best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Thursday\nSimilar to Wednesdays, the best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and again at 2 p.m. The 1 p.m. hour drops slightly in engagement.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Friday\nBy the time users have reached the weekend, peak engagement hours dip; however, the majority of the workday still captures moderate engagement. Yet the best time to post on Instagram on Fridays is at 11 a.m., but can see almost as much engagement the few hours prior and after that peak engagement time.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Saturday\nGenerally speaking, we’ve noticed that Saturdays and Sundays have less engagement during the rest of the week across most social platforms. Even with Instagram, there’s a significant decrease during the weekends than during weekdays.

So instead of covering specific trends that might be out of date by the time we finish typing this sentence, we’re going to cover broader trends and cite some current examples.\n\n\n\n\nGet our 2024 Social Trends report, and dig into the juicy data that’ll help you reach your goals in 2024—which is shaping up to be social’s best year yet.\n\n\n\n11 most important 2024 Instagram trends\n1. Challenges continue to rule on Reels\nTrending challenges embrace a lighter side of social media, and foster a sense of community among Instagram users. Dance challenges, exercise challenges, riddles and other popular tests of strength or smarts are virtually always circulating on the platform: take a scroll through your Reels and you’re sure to come across them.\nFor example, right now there’s a challenge going around where folks ask their friends, family or coworkers to try and jump without bending their knees.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by BuzzFeed (@buzzfeed)\n\n\n\nChallenges can also be posed from the poster to the audience—for instance, in “guess who’s singing” challenges, users can reply in the comments with their guesses.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by A Cappella Academy | 501(c)(3) (@acappellacademy)\n\n\n\nThe “Roman empire” trend could also be considered a challenge, where users ask men in their lives how often they think about the Roman empire…\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lex nicoleta (@lex_nicoleta)\n\n\n\n… with varying results.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Calum Worthy (@calumworthy)\n\n\n\n2. Replying with Reels creates conversations\nInstagram took a note from TikTok and introduced “reply Reels” to give creators and brands more opportunities to meaningfully engage with their audiences. When a user leaves a comment on a public Reel, the poster of the Reel can reply to it with another video, creating a dialogue with the commenter.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mike Archangelo (@mikearchangelo)\n\n\n\nSometimes, reply Reels answer questions or draw attention to positive feedback—the video above is answering a question, and is meant for educational purposes. But it’s also common for users to use Reel replies to respond to negative comments… to clap back, if you will.\n3. AI generates new opportunities\nEek, robots are taking over the world — Instagram included. Many IG users are using AI to generate content ideas, write captions and even edit photos and videos.\nAnd that’s fair game! AI can help you painlessly fill up your content calendar. Just remember: you’re still the brains of the operation. Don’t take AI-generated posts and ideas at face value. Make edits when necessary to make sure that everything that goes live is aligned with your goals and brand guidelines.\nHootsuite, for example, has Owlywriter AI for instant captions, repurposing past content and coming up with fresh campaigns. Sign up for a free 30-day trial to check it out!\n\n4. Photo dumps keep it real\nAn Instagram photo dump is a collection of images posted in a carousel (sidenote: Instagram carousel posts, on average, get three times as much engagement as a single feed photo post does). Photo dumps generally include a variety of different kinds of images and also a variety of image qualities.\nPhoto dumps are evidence of a movement away from the polished, edited, filtered content that Instagram has become known for. Photo dumps are a more casual and honest representation of the way we actually live: blurry photos, messy spaces and screenshots of memes are the usual suspects in a standard dump.\nFor excellent examples of photo dumps, look no further than Gen Z celebrities: they’ve created an art form.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter)\n\n\n\n5. Text posts thrive on the ‘gram\nInstagram is, first and foremost, a photo- and video-sharing app… right? That may be true, but the definition of a photo or video continues to be blurred by social media. Think about collections of memes, or screenshots of Tweets (which are now just called posts, we guess, since Twitter rebranded as X).\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CwgK6PzM-GN/\nGorgeous, high-resolution photos will always be winners on Instagram, but text posts are trending, too. A simple note or relatable screengrab is super sharable, and continues to be a low-maintenance minefield of content.\nPro tip: if you’re posting text-based images on Instagram, make sure you’re making them accessible. Not everyone is able to use vision to take in information, and you want your content to reach as many people as possible. Use the alt text field to type out the words in your post so that everyone can read them.\n6. The future of Threads is uncertain\nThis is in contrast to the point above: while text does well on Instagram, IG’s text-based offshoot isn’t exactly thriving.\nMeta introduced Threads, a text-based “update” app, in summer 2023. Threads uses the same login info as Instagram, meaning that if you already have an IG account, you’ve got a Threads account, too — it’s just waiting for you to sign in.\nWhen it comes down to it, the best way to describe Threads is “like Twitter” or “like X, the app formerly known as Twitter.” It’s certainly intended as a direct competitor. At first, it seemed like threads might actually be the new tweets, but as news outlets report that Threads daily active user numbers are falling, the future isn’t clear.\nThe takeaway? Using Threads is an excellent way to enhance your social presence, but now’s probably not the time to invest all of your resources into that one platform.\n7. Working together with Instagram collab posts\nNot only are Instagram collab posts used as engagement announcements by every annoying person you went to high school with — they’re also super helpful for business partnerships. Instagram collab posts allow for two or more accounts to post the same content and share the likes, comments and other engagement-boosting analytics.\nFor example, take this collab post with Lululemon, Peloton and several influential fitness creators: it has 36 thousand likes and over 800 comments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lululemon (@lululemon)\n\n\n\nPosting in collaboration with another user automatically expands your reach. It gives you the opportunity to be seen by not only your followers, but by your collaborator’s followers as well.\nCollab posts are great for relationship-building (in marketing and in life) and often produce win-win results for both parties.\n8. Driving traffic with a link in bio\nThere’s lots of ways to make money on Instagram, but most of them involve making money indirectly. In other words, Instagram isn’t paying you, it’s just a tool you use to guide consumers towards your business. To actually convert your IG audience into paying customers, you’ll need to use your link in bio.\nTake this post from Bon Appetit, for example. Instead of posting the recipe, the Instagram post is used to direct audiences to the company’s website (which, in turn, directs them to signing up for a paid subscription).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by bonappetitmag (@bonappetitmag)\n\n\n\nCreators use their link in bio to direct followers to their online store or Youtube page, retailers use it to direct people to their ecommerce platform, actors use it to link to upcoming projects. It’s a super-diverse, super-useful part of Instagram, and if you’re not using it, this is your sign.\n9. Music, music everywhere\nYou can’t hear a photo, right? Wrong — at least, that’s not the case on Instagram anymore. Now, you can add audio to your still photos and carousels, which helps to boost how engaging your content is.\nThat means you can now add music to your Reels, Instagram stories and your posts: you can’t stop the beat. As videos become more and more prominent on the platform, creators are looking for ways to make their photos more captivating, and adding music is a free and easy way to boost a still image’s wow-factor.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Universal Music Ireland (@universalmusicireland)\n\n\n\n(Unfortunately, music isn’t actually everywhere—still photos posted with audio can only be heard using Instagram’s mobile app, so if you’re reading this on a computer, the embedded post above won’t look like it has audio. You’ll have to open it on the app to prove it. Alternatively, you can hum a tune yourself.)\n10. Eating around the world\nAccording to Meta’s 2023 Instagram trends report, 68% of Gen Z social media users “will either continue or would like to try food from another culture after discovering it online.”\nFood has always had a huge presence on IG, but modern, younger foodies are more curious and open to trying new foods from other parts of the world.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Maangchi (@maangchi)\n\n\n\nMaangchi’s Korean cooking videos are popular worldwide, and her comments are flooded with folks who are grateful for her lessons on authentic Korean techniques.\n11. Soft launches aren’t just for relationships\nOn Instagram, you may know a “soft launch” as a way for people to hint at a new relationship in their life—rather than showing full commitment by posting a full-face photo of a new partner on their grid, folks are teasing the concept of a new boo by posting blurry or partially hidden pics on their story.\nAnd brands are doing it, too: teasing new products, concepts or services through soft launches on the ‘gram. It’s a way to hype up the news and create some buzz around the brand (similar to how a soft launch of your new boyfriend hopefully will instigate some gossip).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mejuri (@mejuri)\n\n\n\nHere’s an example from jewelry brand Mejuri. The business posted several videos leading up to a sale, and encouraged followers to sign up for a membership to get early access to the deals. Instead of giving away all of the information at once, they’re creating an exclusive opportunity and a bit of mystery.\nTrending Instagram hashtags\nTLDR: Instagram doesn’t publish a list of trending hashtags. So, we had to do some digging.\nThe best Instagram hashtags for you will depend on your specific niche, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for hashtagging on Instagram.\nPlus, using the most popular hashtags doesn’t necessarily mean your post will be successful: #love has been used more than two billion times, meaning that finding a specific post by searching that tag would be basically impossible.\nSo, let’s use an example: say I’m a baker from Vancouver posting some vegan chocolate chip cookies.\nHootsuite has a free hashtag generator to help you come up with ideas—once I type in a description and some keywords…\n\n… some great hashtags are generated for me.\n\nYou can also use the autocomplete on the explore page to come up with ideas–for example, this is what comes up when I start typing “vegan.”\n\nUsing Hootsuite’s social listening technology can also help to identify trending hashtags in your industry (start listening here).\nTrending audio on Instagram\nTrending audio is a little easier to find than trending hashtags, because audio is less niche-specific… but, audio trends change daily. What’s trending on Instagram at the time this post is written might not be trending at the time you’re reading it. So, instead of letting you know what’s’ trending as of the date this blog post is published (it’s “Stick Season”), here are some ways to find what audio is trending, well, now.\nTo find trending audio for an Instagram Reel, open the Instagram Reel editor and tap the music icon. From there, Instagram will show you music it thinks you’ll like. Any song with the “up” arrow next to it is trending upward.\n\nSource: Instagram\nWhen you’re watching Reels, you can also identify if the audio is trending by that arrow—it’s located in the bottom left of the screen.\n\nSource: Instagram\nIf you have more questions about Instagram audio, chances are we’ve answered them here.\nHow to identify and keep up with the latest Instagram trends\nBecause Instagram marketing trends are (literally) always changing and evolving, it’s important to develop strategies to keep up. Here are some hacks for staying in the game.\nRead a social media blog (like Hootsuite)\nWow, genius! You’re already doing it. Hootsuite — and other blogs like it, but come on, we’re the best — keeps up with social trends, conducts social media experiments and gathers useful information all in one spot. Follow social marketing platforms, subscribe to newsletters and check in often.\nFollow Instagram… on Instagram\nAnother no-brainer. Follow Instagram, Meta, and Adam Mosseri on IG, Linkedin, Threads and the platform formerly known as Twitter to stay up to date with new features—new technology often leads to new trends.\nUse the Explore page\nInstagram’s Explore page shows posts that the platform thinks you’ll like, but it’s also a great place to see what topics are on the rise. Just hit the “Search” field and the app will show you a bunch of subjects that are trending. Scroll to the left for more.\nFor example, at the moment this blog post is being written, topics like “pause challenge,” “christmas tree decoration,” “kitchen interior,” “motivational quotes,” “david beckham,” “short hair” and “pedro pascal” are trending.\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\nManage your Instagram presence alongside your other social channels and save time using Hootsuite.

The 'Hootsuite' blog provided comprehensive information on the latest Instagram trends for 2024. Some of the key trends include challenges on Reels, the use of AI, photo dumps, text posts, Instagram collab posts, the use of link in bio, addition of music to posts, and the increasing popularity of food from different cultures. Next, I need to research on optimal posting times on Instagram.

time to post on Instagram. Instagram’s visual nature makes it a desirable marketing platform for brands to get their offerings in front of as many eyes as possible, and knowing the best times to post on Instagram can be a major benefit to your social media strategy.\nRemember: with Instagram as a discovery platform of trends, brands, products or services, it’s important to get high-quality photos and content in front of potential consumers’ eyes at the right time.\nLearn how to identify your best times to post on Instagram with a free trial of Sprout Social and test our ViralPost® feature.\nStart a free Sprout Social trial\nDisclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded globally (not by Central Time), meaning you should be able to publish with the times provided in any timezone and see positive engagement results. Number of engagements represents total engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level engagement times. We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in 2024?\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\n\nWhen are the best times to post Reels on Instagram?\nAre the best times to post on Instagram different for static posts versus Reels? Perhaps there’s a definitive answer to that question, however, our data source is inclusive of posts, Stories and Reels. The information in this article should guide you to uncover the best times to post any content on Instagram to see positive engagement, whether it’s a static post, a Story with polls or a creative Reel.\nThe best times to post Reels on Instagram will be similar to our data above: weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. Our optimal send time data for Instagram is aggregate for Posts, Reels and Stories – both images and videos.\nFor that reason, we recommend you test posting Reels at different times to uncover the highest engagement times for you. Keep in mind that several factors go into Reels’ performance, whether it’s using trending sounds, the Instagram algorithm or having an engaging video hook to capture your audience’s attention.\n\n\nWhat is the best day and time to post on Instagram?\nWe know the best time to post on Instagram overall, but what about for each day of the week? If you’re looking for the best day and time to post on Instagram, read the analysis below.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Monday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Mondays is from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. While there’s decent engagement from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., optimal send and engagement times are those few hours during a typical lunch break.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Tuesday\nThere’s nearly double the highest engagement times on Tuesdays than there are on Mondays. The best time to post on Instagram on Tuesdays is from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Wednesday\nWednesdays see the highest engagement periods than any other day of the week, with even the moderately high engagement times spanning more hours than Tuesdays or Thursdays. The best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Thursday\nSimilar to Wednesdays, the best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and again at 2 p.m. The 1 p.m. hour drops slightly in engagement.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Friday\nBy the time users have reached the weekend, peak engagement hours dip; however, the majority of the workday still captures moderate engagement. Yet the best time to post on Instagram on Fridays is at 11 a.m., but can see almost as much engagement the few hours prior and after that peak engagement time.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Saturday\nGenerally speaking, we’ve noticed that Saturdays and Sundays have less engagement during the rest of the week across most social platforms. Even with Instagram, there’s a significant decrease during the weekends than during weekdays. With that in mind, you’ll still see light to average engagement on the app. The best time to post on Instagram on Saturdays is 9 a.m. to noon, in relation to the rest of the day.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Sunday\nSimilar to Saturdays, we’ve noticed Sundays have less engagement throughout the day across most, if not all, social platforms. In relation to the day itself, the best time to post on Instagram on Sundays is 10 a.m. to noon.\n\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in the UK?\nThe overall best time to post on Instagram in the UK is weekdays between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Midweek, engagement rates remain high until 4 p.m. Things are noticeably quieter at the weekend across many social platforms, including Instagram in the UK. Taking this into account, the best time to post on Saturday is 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 10 am to 12 p.m. on Sundays. If Instagram is the platform your UK audience engages with most, remember your industry, business goals and content will also play a part in the success of your social posts.\n\n\nWhat are the best times to post on Instagram by industry?\nThere’s no definitive answer to what the best times to post on Instagram are. We can only offer insight with the data we have. Industry is just one factor that plays into the success of your social posts. Consider as well as your target audience, business goals and the content itself.\nUse this industry-level data to help inform your publishing calendar, and test your optimal send times with social experiments.\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for hospitals & healthcare\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare:\n\nMondays at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.\nTuesdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.\nThursdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.\nFridays from 11 a..m. to 3 p.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare: Tuesdays through Fridays\nWorst days to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare: Sundays\n\nHospitals, clinics and healthcare providers use social media for more than navigating healthcare crises.

Keep in mind that some schools manage multiple social profiles (per college, athletics, etc.) to meet these needs and effectively target distinct audiences at the right time.\xa0\nHigh opportunities for engagement for schools reflect a typical school day plus evening hours. Mondays through Fridayys see consistent engagement from 10 a.m. until about 6 p.m. However, the hours with the highest engagement and therefore the best time to post on Instagram for schools are Wednesdays from 2 to 4 p.m. and again at 9 p.m.\nFrom highlighting student life to sharing school updates, a social media strategy for schools needs to fulfill various purposes: from engaging with students past, present and future, to keeping a pulse on brand health.\nSchools and education social media resources\n\n15 ways to use social media for education\nUniversity branding: How to build your school’s brand on social media\nHigher ed playbook: Using social to unite your university\n\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for travel & hospitality\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for Travel & Hospitality:\n\nWednesdays from noon to 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.\nSundays from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram for Travel & Hospitality:\n\nWednesdays and Thursdays\n\n\nWorst days to post on Instagram for Travel & Hospitality:\n\nNone; all days receive moderate engagement\n\n\n\nTravel and hospitality industries once again doubled their engagement on Instagram relative to last year.

Challenges continue to rule on Reels\nTrending challenges embrace a lighter side of social media, and foster a sense of community among Instagram users. Dance challenges, exercise challenges, riddles and other popular tests of strength or smarts are virtually always circulating on the platform: take a scroll through your Reels and you’re sure to come across them.\nFor example, right now there’s a challenge going around where folks ask their friends, family or coworkers to try and jump without bending their knees.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by BuzzFeed (@buzzfeed)\n\n\n\nChallenges can also be posed from the poster to the audience—for instance, in “guess who’s singing” challenges, users can reply in the comments with their guesses.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by A Cappella Academy | 501(c)(3) (@acappellacademy)\n\n\n\nThe “Roman empire” trend could also be considered a challenge, where users ask men in their lives how often they think about the Roman empire…\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lex nicoleta (@lex_nicoleta)\n\n\n\n… with varying results.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Calum Worthy (@calumworthy)\n\n\n\n2. Replying with Reels creates conversations\nInstagram took a note from TikTok and introduced “reply Reels” to give creators and brands more opportunities to meaningfully engage with their audiences. When a user leaves a comment on a public Reel, the poster of the Reel can reply to it with another video, creating a dialogue with the commenter.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mike Archangelo (@mikearchangelo)\n\n\n\nSometimes, reply Reels answer questions or draw attention to positive feedback—the video above is answering a question, and is meant for educational purposes. But it’s also common for users to use Reel replies to respond to negative comments… to clap back, if you will.\n3. AI generates new opportunities\nEek, robots are taking over the world — Instagram included. Many IG users are using AI to generate content ideas, write captions and even edit photos and videos.\nAnd that’s fair game! AI can help you painlessly fill up your content calendar. Just remember: you’re still the brains of the operation. Don’t take AI-generated posts and ideas at face value. Make edits when necessary to make sure that everything that goes live is aligned with your goals and brand guidelines.\nHootsuite, for example, has Owlywriter AI for instant captions, repurposing past content and coming up with fresh campaigns. Sign up for a free 30-day trial to check it out!\n\n4. Photo dumps keep it real\nAn Instagram photo dump is a collection of images posted in a carousel (sidenote: Instagram carousel posts, on average, get three times as much engagement as a single feed photo post does). Photo dumps generally include a variety of different kinds of images and also a variety of image qualities.\nPhoto dumps are evidence of a movement away from the polished, edited, filtered content that Instagram has become known for. Photo dumps are a more casual and honest representation of the way we actually live: blurry photos, messy spaces and screenshots of memes are the usual suspects in a standard dump.\nFor excellent examples of photo dumps, look no further than Gen Z celebrities: they’ve created an art form.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter)\n\n\n\n5. Text posts thrive on the ‘gram\nInstagram is, first and foremost, a photo- and video-sharing app… right? That may be true, but the definition of a photo or video continues to be blurred by social media. Think about collections of memes, or screenshots of Tweets (which are now just called posts, we guess, since Twitter rebranded as X).\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CwgK6PzM-GN/\nGorgeous, high-resolution photos will always be winners on Instagram, but text posts are trending, too. A simple note or relatable screengrab is super sharable, and continues to be a low-maintenance minefield of content.\nPro tip: if you’re posting text-based images on Instagram, make sure you’re making them accessible. Not everyone is able to use vision to take in information, and you want your content to reach as many people as possible. Use the alt text field to type out the words in your post so that everyone can read them.\n6. The future of Threads is uncertain\nThis is in contrast to the point above: while text does well on Instagram, IG’s text-based offshoot isn’t exactly thriving.\nMeta introduced Threads, a text-based “update” app, in summer 2023. Threads uses the same login info as Instagram, meaning that if you already have an IG account, you’ve got a Threads account, too — it’s just waiting for you to sign in.\nWhen it comes down to it, the best way to describe Threads is “like Twitter” or “like X, the app formerly known as Twitter.” It’s certainly intended as a direct competitor. At first, it seemed like threads might actually be the new tweets, but as news outlets report that Threads daily active user numbers are falling, the future isn’t clear.\nThe takeaway? Using Threads is an excellent way to enhance your social presence, but now’s probably not the time to invest all of your resources into that one platform.\n7. Working together with Instagram collab posts\nNot only are Instagram collab posts used as engagement announcements by every annoying person you went to high school with — they’re also super helpful for business partnerships. Instagram collab posts allow for two or more accounts to post the same content and share the likes, comments and other engagement-boosting analytics.\nFor example, take this collab post with Lululemon, Peloton and several influential fitness creators: it has 36 thousand likes and over 800 comments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lululemon (@lululemon)\n\n\n\nPosting in collaboration with another user automatically expands your reach. It gives you the opportunity to be seen by not only your followers, but by your collaborator’s followers as well.\nCollab posts are great for relationship-building (in marketing and in life) and often produce win-win results for both parties.\n8. Driving traffic with a link in bio\nThere’s lots of ways to make money on Instagram, but most of them involve making money indirectly. In other words, Instagram isn’t paying you, it’s just a tool you use to guide consumers towards your business. To actually convert your IG audience into paying customers, you’ll need to use your link in bio.\nTake this post from Bon Appetit, for example. Instead of posting the recipe, the Instagram post is used to direct audiences to the company’s website (which, in turn, directs them to signing up for a paid subscription).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by bonappetitmag (@bonappetitmag)\n\n\n\nCreators use their link in bio to direct followers to their online store or Youtube page, retailers use it to direct people to their ecommerce platform, actors use it to link to upcoming projects. It’s a super-diverse, super-useful part of Instagram, and if you’re not using it, this is your sign.\n9. Music, music everywhere\nYou can’t hear a photo, right? Wrong — at least, that’s not the case on Instagram anymore. Now, you can add audio to your still photos and carousels, which helps to boost how engaging your content is.\nThat means you can now add music to your Reels, Instagram stories and your posts: you can’t stop the beat. As videos become more and more prominent on the platform, creators are looking for ways to make their photos more captivating, and adding music is a free and easy way to boost a still image’s wow-factor.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Universal Music Ireland (@universalmusicireland)\n\n\n\n(Unfortunately, music isn’t actually everywhere—still photos posted with audio can only be heard using Instagram’s mobile app, so if you’re reading this on a computer, the embedded post above won’t look like it has audio. You’ll have to open it on the app to prove it. Alternatively, you can hum a tune yourself.)\n10. Eating around the world\nAccording to Meta’s 2023 Instagram trends report, 68% of Gen Z social media users “will either continue or would like to try food from another culture after discovering it online.”\nFood has always had a huge presence on IG, but modern, younger foodies are more curious and open to trying new foods from other parts of the world.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Maangchi (@maangchi)\n\n\n\nMaangchi’s Korean cooking videos are popular worldwide, and her comments are flooded with folks who are grateful for her lessons on authentic Korean techniques.\n11. Soft launches aren’t just for relationships\nOn Instagram, you may know a “soft launch” as a way for people to hint at a new relationship in their life—rather than showing full commitment by posting a full-face photo of a new partner on their grid, folks are teasing the concept of a new boo by posting blurry or partially hidden pics on their story.\nAnd brands are doing it, too: teasing new products, concepts or services through soft launches on the ‘gram. It’s a way to hype up the news and create some buzz around the brand (similar to how a soft launch of your new boyfriend hopefully will instigate some gossip).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mejuri (@mejuri)\n\n\n\nHere’s an example from jewelry brand Mejuri. The business posted several videos leading up to a sale, and encouraged followers to sign up for a membership to get early access to the deals. Instead of giving away all of the information at once, they’re creating an exclusive opportunity and a bit of mystery.\nTrending Instagram hashtags\nTLDR: Instagram doesn’t publish a list of trending hashtags. So, we had to do some digging.\nThe best Instagram hashtags for you will depend on your specific niche, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for hashtagging on Instagram.\nPlus, using the most popular hashtags doesn’t necessarily mean your post will be successful: #love has been used more than two billion times, meaning that finding a specific post by searching that tag would be basically impossible.\nSo, let’s use an example: say I’m a baker from Vancouver posting some vegan chocolate chip cookies.\nHootsuite has a free hashtag generator to help you come up with ideas—once I type in a description and some keywords…\n\n… some great hashtags are generated for me.\n\nYou can also use the autocomplete on the explore page to come up with ideas–for example, this is what comes up when I start typing “vegan.”\n\nUsing Hootsuite’s social listening technology can also help to identify trending hashtags in your industry (start listening here).\nTrending audio on Instagram\nTrending audio is a little easier to find than trending hashtags, because audio is less niche-specific… but, audio trends change daily. What’s trending on Instagram at the time this post is written might not be trending at the time you’re reading it. So, instead of letting you know what’s’ trending as of the date this blog post is published (it’s “Stick Season”), here are some ways to find what audio is trending, well, now.\nTo find trending audio for an Instagram Reel, open the Instagram Reel editor and tap the music icon. From there, Instagram will show you music it thinks you’ll like. Any song with the “up” arrow next to it is trending upward.\n\nSource: Instagram\nWhen you’re watching Reels, you can also identify if the audio is trending by that arrow—it’s located in the bottom left of the screen.\n\nSource: Instagram\nIf you have more questions about Instagram audio, chances are we’ve answered them here.\nHow to identify and keep up with the latest Instagram trends\nBecause Instagram marketing trends are (literally) always changing and evolving, it’s important to develop strategies to keep up. Here are some hacks for staying in the game.\nRead a social media blog (like Hootsuite)\nWow, genius! You’re already doing it. Hootsuite — and other blogs like it, but come on, we’re the best — keeps up with social trends, conducts social media experiments and gathers useful information all in one spot. Follow social marketing platforms, subscribe to newsletters and check in often.\nFollow Instagram… on Instagram\nAnother no-brainer. Follow Instagram, Meta, and Adam Mosseri on IG, Linkedin, Threads and the platform formerly known as Twitter to stay up to date with new features—new technology often leads to new trends.\nUse the Explore page\nInstagram’s Explore page shows posts that the platform thinks you’ll like, but it’s also a great place to see what topics are on the rise. Just hit the “Search” field and the app will show you a bunch of subjects that are trending. Scroll to the left for more.\nFor example, at the moment this blog post is being written, topics like “pause challenge,” “christmas tree decoration,” “kitchen interior,” “motivational quotes,” “david beckham,” “short hair” and “pedro pascal” are trending.\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\nManage your Instagram presence alongside your other social channels and save time using Hootsuite.

The Hootsuite article provides a comprehensive list of Instagram trends for 2024, which includes challenges on Reels, AI-generated content, photo dumps, text posts, Instagram collab posts, link in bio for traffic drive, music in posts, food exploration, and soft product launches. It also discusses how to identify and keep up with the latest Instagram trends. However, it doesn't provide data on optimal posting times and audience preferences. I need to conduct more research on these aspects.

time to post on Instagram. Instagram’s visual nature makes it a desirable marketing platform for brands to get their offerings in front of as many eyes as possible, and knowing the best times to post on Instagram can be a major benefit to your social media strategy.\nRemember: with Instagram as a discovery platform of trends, brands, products or services, it’s important to get high-quality photos and content in front of potential consumers’ eyes at the right time.\nLearn how to identify your best times to post on Instagram with a free trial of Sprout Social and test our ViralPost® feature.\nStart a free Sprout Social trial\nDisclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded globally (not by Central Time), meaning you should be able to publish with the times provided in any timezone and see positive engagement results. Number of engagements represents total engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level engagement times. We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in 2024?\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\n\nWhen are the best times to post Reels on Instagram?\nAre the best times to post on Instagram different for static posts versus Reels? Perhaps there’s a definitive answer to that question, however, our data source is inclusive of posts, Stories and Reels. The information in this article should guide you to uncover the best times to post any content on Instagram to see positive engagement, whether it’s a static post, a Story with polls or a creative Reel.\nThe best times to post Reels on Instagram will be similar to our data above: weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. Our optimal send time data for Instagram is aggregate for Posts, Reels and Stories – both images and videos.\nFor that reason, we recommend you test posting Reels at different times to uncover the highest engagement times for you. Keep in mind that several factors go into Reels’ performance, whether it’s using trending sounds, the Instagram algorithm or having an engaging video hook to capture your audience’s attention.\n\n\nWhat is the best day and time to post on Instagram?\nWe know the best time to post on Instagram overall, but what about for each day of the week? If you’re looking for the best day and time to post on Instagram, read the analysis below.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Monday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Mondays is from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. While there’s decent engagement from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., optimal send and engagement times are those few hours during a typical lunch break.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Tuesday\nThere’s nearly double the highest engagement times on Tuesdays than there are on Mondays.

So instead of covering specific trends that might be out of date by the time we finish typing this sentence, we’re going to cover broader trends and cite some current examples.\n\n\n\n\nGet our 2024 Social Trends report, and dig into the juicy data that’ll help you reach your goals in 2024—which is shaping up to be social’s best year yet.\n\n\n\n11 most important 2024 Instagram trends\n1. Challenges continue to rule on Reels\nTrending challenges embrace a lighter side of social media, and foster a sense of community among Instagram users. Dance challenges, exercise challenges, riddles and other popular tests of strength or smarts are virtually always circulating on the platform: take a scroll through your Reels and you’re sure to come across them.\nFor example, right now there’s a challenge going around where folks ask their friends, family or coworkers to try and jump without bending their knees.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by BuzzFeed (@buzzfeed)\n\n\n\nChallenges can also be posed from the poster to the audience—for instance, in “guess who’s singing” challenges, users can reply in the comments with their guesses.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by A Cappella Academy | 501(c)(3) (@acappellacademy)\n\n\n\nThe “Roman empire” trend could also be considered a challenge, where users ask men in their lives how often they think about the Roman empire…\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lex nicoleta (@lex_nicoleta)\n\n\n\n… with varying results.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Calum Worthy (@calumworthy)\n\n\n\n2. Replying with Reels creates conversations\nInstagram took a note from TikTok and introduced “reply Reels” to give creators and brands more opportunities to meaningfully engage with their audiences. When a user leaves a comment on a public Reel, the poster of the Reel can reply to it with another video, creating a dialogue with the commenter.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mike Archangelo (@mikearchangelo)\n\n\n\nSometimes, reply Reels answer questions or draw attention to positive feedback—the video above is answering a question, and is meant for educational purposes. But it’s also common for users to use Reel replies to respond to negative comments… to clap back, if you will.\n3. AI generates new opportunities\nEek, robots are taking over the world — Instagram included. Many IG users are using AI to generate content ideas, write captions and even edit photos and videos.\nAnd that’s fair game! AI can help you painlessly fill up your content calendar. Just remember: you’re still the brains of the operation. Don’t take AI-generated posts and ideas at face value. Make edits when necessary to make sure that everything that goes live is aligned with your goals and brand guidelines.\nHootsuite, for example, has Owlywriter AI for instant captions, repurposing past content and coming up with fresh campaigns. Sign up for a free 30-day trial to check it out!\n\n4. Photo dumps keep it real\nAn Instagram photo dump is a collection of images posted in a carousel (sidenote: Instagram carousel posts, on average, get three times as much engagement as a single feed photo post does). Photo dumps generally include a variety of different kinds of images and also a variety of image qualities.\nPhoto dumps are evidence of a movement away from the polished, edited, filtered content that Instagram has become known for. Photo dumps are a more casual and honest representation of the way we actually live: blurry photos, messy spaces and screenshots of memes are the usual suspects in a standard dump.\nFor excellent examples of photo dumps, look no further than Gen Z celebrities: they’ve created an art form.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter)\n\n\n\n5. Text posts thrive on the ‘gram\nInstagram is, first and foremost, a photo- and video-sharing app… right? That may be true, but the definition of a photo or video continues to be blurred by social media. Think about collections of memes, or screenshots of Tweets (which are now just called posts, we guess, since Twitter rebranded as X).\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CwgK6PzM-GN/\nGorgeous, high-resolution photos will always be winners on Instagram, but text posts are trending, too. A simple note or relatable screengrab is super sharable, and continues to be a low-maintenance minefield of content.\nPro tip: if you’re posting text-based images on Instagram, make sure you’re making them accessible. Not everyone is able to use vision to take in information, and you want your content to reach as many people as possible. Use the alt text field to type out the words in your post so that everyone can read them.\n6. The future of Threads is uncertain\nThis is in contrast to the point above: while text does well on Instagram, IG’s text-based offshoot isn’t exactly thriving.\nMeta introduced Threads, a text-based “update” app, in summer 2023. Threads uses the same login info as Instagram, meaning that if you already have an IG account, you’ve got a Threads account, too — it’s just waiting for you to sign in.\nWhen it comes down to it, the best way to describe Threads is “like Twitter” or “like X, the app formerly known as Twitter.” It’s certainly intended as a direct competitor. At first, it seemed like threads might actually be the new tweets, but as news outlets report that Threads daily active user numbers are falling, the future isn’t clear.\nThe takeaway? Using Threads is an excellent way to enhance your social presence, but now’s probably not the time to invest all of your resources into that one platform.\n7. Working together with Instagram collab posts\nNot only are Instagram collab posts used as engagement announcements by every annoying person you went to high school with — they’re also super helpful for business partnerships. Instagram collab posts allow for two or more accounts to post the same content and share the likes, comments and other engagement-boosting analytics.\nFor example, take this collab post with Lululemon, Peloton and several influential fitness creators: it has 36 thousand likes and over 800 comments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lululemon (@lululemon)\n\n\n\nPosting in collaboration with another user automatically expands your reach. It gives you the opportunity to be seen by not only your followers, but by your collaborator’s followers as well.\nCollab posts are great for relationship-building (in marketing and in life) and often produce win-win results for both parties.\n8. Driving traffic with a link in bio\nThere’s lots of ways to make money on Instagram, but most of them involve making money indirectly. In other words, Instagram isn’t paying you, it’s just a tool you use to guide consumers towards your business. To actually convert your IG audience into paying customers, you’ll need to use your link in bio.\nTake this post from Bon Appetit, for example. Instead of posting the recipe, the Instagram post is used to direct audiences to the company’s website (which, in turn, directs them to signing up for a paid subscription).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by bonappetitmag (@bonappetitmag)\n\n\n\nCreators use their link in bio to direct followers to their online store or Youtube page, retailers use it to direct people to their ecommerce platform, actors use it to link to upcoming projects. It’s a super-diverse, super-useful part of Instagram, and if you’re not using it, this is your sign.\n9. Music, music everywhere\nYou can’t hear a photo, right? Wrong — at least, that’s not the case on Instagram anymore. Now, you can add audio to your still photos and carousels, which helps to boost how engaging your content is.\nThat means you can now add music to your Reels, Instagram stories and your posts: you can’t stop the beat. As videos become more and more prominent on the platform, creators are looking for ways to make their photos more captivating, and adding music is a free and easy way to boost a still image’s wow-factor.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Universal Music Ireland (@universalmusicireland)\n\n\n\n(Unfortunately, music isn’t actually everywhere—still photos posted with audio can only be heard using Instagram’s mobile app, so if you’re reading this on a computer, the embedded post above won’t look like it has audio. You’ll have to open it on the app to prove it. Alternatively, you can hum a tune yourself.)\n10. Eating around the world\nAccording to Meta’s 2023 Instagram trends report, 68% of Gen Z social media users “will either continue or would like to try food from another culture after discovering it online.”\nFood has always had a huge presence on IG, but modern, younger foodies are more curious and open to trying new foods from other parts of the world.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Maangchi (@maangchi)\n\n\n\nMaangchi’s Korean cooking videos are popular worldwide, and her comments are flooded with folks who are grateful for her lessons on authentic Korean techniques.\n11. Soft launches aren’t just for relationships\nOn Instagram, you may know a “soft launch” as a way for people to hint at a new relationship in their life—rather than showing full commitment by posting a full-face photo of a new partner on their grid, folks are teasing the concept of a new boo by posting blurry or partially hidden pics on their story.\nAnd brands are doing it, too: teasing new products, concepts or services through soft launches on the ‘gram. It’s a way to hype up the news and create some buzz around the brand (similar to how a soft launch of your new boyfriend hopefully will instigate some gossip).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mejuri (@mejuri)\n\n\n\nHere’s an example from jewelry brand Mejuri. The business posted several videos leading up to a sale, and encouraged followers to sign up for a membership to get early access to the deals. Instead of giving away all of the information at once, they’re creating an exclusive opportunity and a bit of mystery.\nTrending Instagram hashtags\nTLDR: Instagram doesn’t publish a list of trending hashtags. So, we had to do some digging.\nThe best Instagram hashtags for you will depend on your specific niche, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for hashtagging on Instagram.\nPlus, using the most popular hashtags doesn’t necessarily mean your post will be successful: #love has been used more than two billion times, meaning that finding a specific post by searching that tag would be basically impossible.\nSo, let’s use an example: say I’m a baker from Vancouver posting some vegan chocolate chip cookies.\nHootsuite has a free hashtag generator to help you come up with ideas—once I type in a description and some keywords…\n\n… some great hashtags are generated for me.\n\nYou can also use the autocomplete on the explore page to come up with ideas–for example, this is what comes up when I start typing “vegan.”\n\nUsing Hootsuite’s social listening technology can also help to identify trending hashtags in your industry (start listening here).\nTrending audio on Instagram\nTrending audio is a little easier to find than trending hashtags, because audio is less niche-specific… but, audio trends change daily. What’s trending on Instagram at the time this post is written might not be trending at the time you’re reading it. So, instead of letting you know what’s’ trending as of the date this blog post is published (it’s “Stick Season”), here are some ways to find what audio is trending, well, now.\nTo find trending audio for an Instagram Reel, open the Instagram Reel editor and tap the music icon. From there, Instagram will show you music it thinks you’ll like. Any song with the “up” arrow next to it is trending upward.\n\nSource: Instagram\nWhen you’re watching Reels, you can also identify if the audio is trending by that arrow—it’s located in the bottom left of the screen.\n\nSource: Instagram\nIf you have more questions about Instagram audio, chances are we’ve answered them here.\nHow to identify and keep up with the latest Instagram trends\nBecause Instagram marketing trends are (literally) always changing and evolving, it’s important to develop strategies to keep up. Here are some hacks for staying in the game.\nRead a social media blog (like Hootsuite)\nWow, genius! You’re already doing it. Hootsuite — and other blogs like it, but come on, we’re the best — keeps up with social trends, conducts social media experiments and gathers useful information all in one spot. Follow social marketing platforms, subscribe to newsletters and check in often.\nFollow Instagram… on Instagram\nAnother no-brainer. Follow Instagram, Meta, and Adam Mosseri on IG, Linkedin, Threads and the platform formerly known as Twitter to stay up to date with new features—new technology often leads to new trends.\nUse the Explore page\nInstagram’s Explore page shows posts that the platform thinks you’ll like, but it’s also a great place to see what topics are on the rise. Just hit the “Search” field and the app will show you a bunch of subjects that are trending. Scroll to the left for more.\nFor example, at the moment this blog post is being written, topics like “pause challenge,” “christmas tree decoration,” “kitchen interior,” “motivational quotes,” “david beckham,” “short hair” and “pedro pascal” are trending.\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\nManage your Instagram presence alongside your other social channels and save time using Hootsuite.

time to post on Instagram. Instagram’s visual nature makes it a desirable marketing platform for brands to get their offerings in front of as many eyes as possible, and knowing the best times to post on Instagram can be a major benefit to your social media strategy.\nRemember: with Instagram as a discovery platform of trends, brands, products or services, it’s important to get high-quality photos and content in front of potential consumers’ eyes at the right time.\nLearn how to identify your best times to post on Instagram with a free trial of Sprout Social and test our ViralPost® feature.\nStart a free Sprout Social trial\nDisclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded globally (not by Central Time), meaning you should be able to publish with the times provided in any timezone and see positive engagement results. Number of engagements represents total engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level engagement times. We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in 2024?\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\n\nWhen are the best times to post Reels on Instagram?\nAre the best times to post on Instagram different for static posts versus Reels? Perhaps there’s a definitive answer to that question, however, our data source is inclusive of posts, Stories and Reels. The information in this article should guide you to uncover the best times to post any content on Instagram to see positive engagement, whether it’s a static post, a Story with polls or a creative Reel.\nThe best times to post Reels on Instagram will be similar to our data above: weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. Our optimal send time data for Instagram is aggregate for Posts, Reels and Stories – both images and videos.\nFor that reason, we recommend you test posting Reels at different times to uncover the highest engagement times for you. Keep in mind that several factors go into Reels’ performance, whether it’s using trending sounds, the Instagram algorithm or having an engaging video hook to capture your audience’s attention.\n\n\nWhat is the best day and time to post on Instagram?\nWe know the best time to post on Instagram overall, but what about for each day of the week? If you’re looking for the best day and time to post on Instagram, read the analysis below.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Monday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Mondays is from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. While there’s decent engagement from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., optimal send and engagement times are those few hours during a typical lunch break.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Tuesday\nThere’s nearly double the highest engagement times on Tuesdays than there are on Mondays. The best time to post on Instagram on Tuesdays is from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Wednesday\nWednesdays see the highest engagement periods than any other day of the week, with even the moderately high engagement times spanning more hours than Tuesdays or Thursdays. The best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Thursday\nSimilar to Wednesdays, the best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and again at 2 p.m. The 1 p.m. hour drops slightly in engagement.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Friday\nBy the time users have reached the weekend, peak engagement hours dip; however, the majority of the workday still captures moderate engagement. Yet the best time to post on Instagram on Fridays is at 11 a.m., but can see almost as much engagement the few hours prior and after that peak engagement time.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Saturday\nGenerally speaking, we’ve noticed that Saturdays and Sundays have less engagement during the rest of the week across most social platforms. Even with Instagram, there’s a significant decrease during the weekends than during weekdays. With that in mind, you’ll still see light to average engagement on the app. The best time to post on Instagram on Saturdays is 9 a.m. to noon, in relation to the rest of the day.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Sunday\nSimilar to Saturdays, we’ve noticed Sundays have less engagement throughout the day across most, if not all, social platforms. In relation to the day itself, the best time to post on Instagram on Sundays is 10 a.m. to noon.\n\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in the UK?\nThe overall best time to post on Instagram in the UK is weekdays between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Midweek, engagement rates remain high until 4 p.m. Things are noticeably quieter at the weekend across many social platforms, including Instagram in the UK. Taking this into account, the best time to post on Saturday is 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 10 am to 12 p.m. on Sundays. If Instagram is the platform your UK audience engages with most, remember your industry, business goals and content will also play a part in the success of your social posts.\n\n\nWhat are the best times to post on Instagram by industry?\nThere’s no definitive answer to what the best times to post on Instagram are. We can only offer insight with the data we have. Industry is just one factor that plays into the success of your social posts. Consider as well as your target audience, business goals and the content itself.\nUse this industry-level data to help inform your publishing calendar, and test your optimal send times with social experiments.\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for hospitals & healthcare\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare:\n\nMondays at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.\nTuesdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.\nThursdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.\nFridays from 11 a..m. to 3 p.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare: Tuesdays through Fridays\nWorst days to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare: Sundays\n\nHospitals, clinics and healthcare providers use social media for more than navigating healthcare crises. Social media is used by hospitals and healthcare providers to educate the public, help patients feel more comfortable with healthcare visits and doctors’ appointments, promote their programs for aspiring physicians and establish themselves as pillars in the community.\nThe best times to post on Instagram for healthcare and hospitals nearly tripled compared to the year prior.

Tell me more! At the forefront of social media since 2010, Instagram has become not only a staple in our phones’ app libraries but also in our everyday lives. With\xa0more than 2 billion active users this fall, the social media giant’s popularity is projected to grow to even greater heights over the coming year. Hoffmann Murtaugh has the exclusive insights every social media marketer needs to know about the Instagram trend forecast for 2022.\xa0Get Ready For A Ride On The Carousel, The Latest Instagram Trend!Instagram users rejoice in knowing that their ‘weekly photo dumps’ aren’t going anywhere in 2022! While the emerging Instagram trend of sharing a user’s top 10 photos to summarize their week is typically for fun, the feature also can positively impact a brand’s marketing strategy. With more content for Instagram users to scroll through and engage within a carousel, consumers are spending more time looking at a brand’s post, and ultimately, at a brand’s Instagram page overall. Plan on seeing more tailored, curated Instagram carousel posts as we head into the new year.\xa0Enhanced Instagram Shopping User ExperienceWhether avoidance of COVID-19 pandemic surges or new habits that have been formed, online shopping is huge. In fact, 54 percent of consumers prefer to shop online. Expect Instagram Shopping to take off in 2022 as more brands become acquainted with the digital storefront feature. Seamlessly and organically integrated within the app, Instagram takes consumers through the entire purchasing experience. Businesses can maximize their sales to broader audiences by exploring all Instagram Shopping has to offer in 2022.\xa0The Continued Rise Of Influencer MarketingHave you purchased a product from someone’s Instagram recommendation? Instagram has been a pioneer in providing a platform for users to follow people whose lifestyles, fashion, fitness, advice, piques their interest and inspiration. As social media influencers gain traction and develop their own communities on Instagram, brands are taking notice. Brands need to start investing in paid partnerships with Instagram users relevant to their target audience. 2022 will expose the full potential of influencers (of all account sizes) in amplifying a brand’s social media marketing efforts.\xa0Gen Z Has Entered The ChatSpeaking of influence—let’s talk about some of the youngest Instagram users driving the incoming trends to fleeting success. Making up approximately 20 percent of the population, Generation Z (those born between 1997-2012) Instagram users have utilized many of the social media network’s unique features to share creative, engaging content with friends, families, and classmates. In a current world of remote learning and limited social gatherings, Instagram allows Gen Z to make up fun dances on Reels, share their music favorites on Stories, and thrifted finds from Shopping. Not only does this generation make use of Instagram’s capabilities, but Gen Z also sparks a conversation for social change. These young users encourage their favorite brands to stand up for causes that matter most to them. Don’t underestimate the power of Gen Z and how they will reshape the narrative on brands on Instagram in 2022.Which Instagram trend from 2021 was your favorite?

time to post on Instagram. Instagram’s visual nature makes it a desirable marketing platform for brands to get their offerings in front of as many eyes as possible, and knowing the best times to post on Instagram can be a major benefit to your social media strategy.\nRemember: with Instagram as a discovery platform of trends, brands, products or services, it’s important to get high-quality photos and content in front of potential consumers’ eyes at the right time.\nLearn how to identify your best times to post on Instagram with a free trial of Sprout Social and test our ViralPost® feature.\nStart a free Sprout Social trial\nDisclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded globally (not by Central Time), meaning you should be able to publish with the times provided in any timezone and see positive engagement results. Number of engagements represents total engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level engagement times. We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in 2024?\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\n\nWhen are the best times to post Reels on Instagram?\nAre the best times to post on Instagram different for static posts versus Reels? Perhaps there’s a definitive answer to that question, however, our data source is inclusive of posts, Stories and Reels. The information in this article should guide you to uncover the best times to post any content on Instagram to see positive engagement, whether it’s a static post, a Story with polls or a creative Reel.\nThe best times to post Reels on Instagram will be similar to our data above: weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. Our optimal send time data for Instagram is aggregate for Posts, Reels and Stories – both images and videos.\nFor that reason, we recommend you test posting Reels at different times to uncover the highest engagement times for you. Keep in mind that several factors go into Reels’ performance, whether it’s using trending sounds, the Instagram algorithm or having an engaging video hook to capture your audience’s attention.\n\n\nWhat is the best day and time to post on Instagram?\nWe know the best time to post on Instagram overall, but what about for each day of the week? If you’re looking for the best day and time to post on Instagram, read the analysis below.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Monday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Mondays is from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. While there’s decent engagement from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., optimal send and engagement times are those few hours during a typical lunch break.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Tuesday\nThere’s nearly double the highest engagement times on Tuesdays than there are on Mondays. The best time to post on Instagram on Tuesdays is from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Wednesday\nWednesdays see the highest engagement periods than any other day of the week, with even the moderately high engagement times spanning more hours than Tuesdays or Thursdays. The best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Thursday\nSimilar to Wednesdays, the best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and again at 2 p.m. The 1 p.m. hour drops slightly in engagement.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Friday\nBy the time users have reached the weekend, peak engagement hours dip; however, the majority of the workday still captures moderate engagement. Yet the best time to post on Instagram on Fridays is at 11 a.m., but can see almost as much engagement the few hours prior and after that peak engagement time.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Saturday\nGenerally speaking, we’ve noticed that Saturdays and Sundays have less engagement during the rest of the week across most social platforms. Even with Instagram, there’s a significant decrease during the weekends than during weekdays. With that in mind, you’ll still see light to average engagement on the app. The best time to post on Instagram on Saturdays is 9 a.m. to noon, in relation to the rest of the day.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Sunday\nSimilar to Saturdays, we’ve noticed Sundays have less engagement throughout the day across most, if not all, social platforms. In relation to the day itself, the best time to post on Instagram on Sundays is 10 a.m. to noon.\n\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in the UK?\nThe overall best time to post on Instagram in the UK is weekdays between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Midweek, engagement rates remain high until 4 p.m. Things are noticeably quieter at the weekend across many social platforms, including Instagram in the UK. Taking this into account, the best time to post on Saturday is 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 10 am to 12 p.m. on Sundays. If Instagram is the platform your UK audience engages with most, remember your industry, business goals and content will also play a part in the success of your social posts.\n\n\nWhat are the best times to post on Instagram by industry?\nThere’s no definitive answer to what the best times to post on Instagram are. We can only offer insight with the data we have. Industry is just one factor that plays into the success of your social posts. Consider as well as your target audience, business goals and the content itself.\nUse this industry-level data to help inform your publishing calendar, and test your optimal send times with social experiments.\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for hospitals & healthcare\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare:\n\nMondays at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.\nTuesdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.\nThursdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.\nFridays from 11 a..m. to 3 p.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare: Tuesdays through Fridays\nWorst days to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare: Sundays\n\nHospitals, clinics and healthcare providers use social media for more than navigating healthcare crises.

Keep in mind that some schools manage multiple social profiles (per college, athletics, etc.) to meet these needs and effectively target distinct audiences at the right time.\xa0\nHigh opportunities for engagement for schools reflect a typical school day plus evening hours. Mondays through Fridayys see consistent engagement from 10 a.m. until about 6 p.m. However, the hours with the highest engagement and therefore the best time to post on Instagram for schools are Wednesdays from 2 to 4 p.m. and again at 9 p.m.\nFrom highlighting student life to sharing school updates, a social media strategy for schools needs to fulfill various purposes: from engaging with students past, present and future, to keeping a pulse on brand health.\nSchools and education social media resources\n\n15 ways to use social media for education\nUniversity branding: How to build your school’s brand on social media\nHigher ed playbook: Using social to unite your university\n\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for travel & hospitality\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for Travel & Hospitality:\n\nWednesdays from noon to 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.\nSundays from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram for Travel & Hospitality:\n\nWednesdays and Thursdays\n\n\nWorst days to post on Instagram for Travel & Hospitality:\n\nNone; all days receive moderate engagement\n\n\n\nTravel and hospitality industries once again doubled their engagement on Instagram relative to last year.

However, if you keep up with the latest Instagram trends, you can leverage these trends as part of your Instagram marketing strategy that grabs attention and fuels growth.\nIn this article, we dive deep into the top nine Instagram trends for 2024. We’ll cover innovative tactics like AI-driven content creation and community building with examples to incorporate them into your own Instagram strategy.\n1. Video takes priority over images\nDo me a favor: Open your Instagram app and scroll through the first 10 to 15 pieces of content. As you scroll, you might notice a common theme—most of the posts are videos.\nInstagram continues to prioritize video—specifically Reels—in 2024. In fact, the platform is regularly releasing new features to encourage creators to make more video content.\nFor example, you can now:\n\nReply to a Reel with another Reel\nAdd new effects, music and voice overs to your Reels\nUpload video stories up to 60 seconds long with no cuts\nHost interactive live streams\n\nLeaning hard into video isn’t just encouraged at this point—it’s essential to thrive on Instagram right now. Convey your brand’s authentic personality. Show your products in action. Give behind-the-scenes glimpses of your team. Talk to your followers in real-time.\nUsing video not only helps you build genuine connections with your audience—it also drives reach and engagement by appealing to the Instagram algorithm.\nInstagram Reel trends for 2024\nInstagram Reels launched in 2020 and slowly rolled out to all users throughout 2021. This micro video addition to Instagram was created to compete with Snapchat and TikTok. It has continued to grow in popularity. Many brands and content creators will repurpose their videos across each of the platforms—TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.\nHere are some Instagram Reel trends popular with brands this year:\nSocial media managers acting as brand spokespeople\nInstead of hiring paid actors to deliver scripted messages, social media managers are now stepping in front of the camera when creating Reels.\nSocial media managers have an intimate understanding of the brand’s voice and values. And they’re able to quickly create content that deeply resonates with the audience at a fraction of the cost. Our social media managers here at Sprout Social hop into Reels from time to time to act as spokespeople for our social media marketing software:\n\nAn added bonus to this is that social media managers’ appearances help build stronger personal connections between the brand and its customers over time.\nVideo memes\nMemes, of course, still are trending on Instagram. Brands are remixing meme Reels with trending audio and putting their own spin on funny clips or pop culture references to be relevant to their brand and audience like Visme did.\n\nRemember to align your meme content with brand values while still showing the lighter side of your business. When done right, it can get lots of positive engagement when you’re conscious to position your brand as relatable and culturally aware.\nInstagram post trends for 2024\nJust because Reels are trending on Instagram doesn’t mean static posts are dead. If you look at your feed, a good 25-30% is likely still are image, video and carousel posts.\nInstagram has also rolled out a small but decent update in this area. You can now add audio to static posts to make them more engaging.\nBrands continue to use Instagram posts in unique, creative ways. Here are some noteworthy trends to watch and try this year:\nPhoto dump\nThis Instagram post trend is specific to carousels. The photo dump involves sharing a series of images that may seem candid and unrelated at first glance but collectively convey a story or a theme.\nIt’s like flipping through someone’s personal photo album. It offers a glimpse into behind-the-scenes moments. For brands, these moments could include events, user-generated content and photoshoots. For example, Coach used this trend to showcase their fashion collection for Fall 2024.\nText posts\nTraditionally, Instagram has been all about the visuals. However, at the moment, there’s a growing trend of text posts. The theme is to make the text post a static image or flip-through series within a carousel.\nBrands are posting stats, listicles, tips, how-tos, quotes, announcements, customer testimonials and more as aesthetically pleasing, minimalistic text posts that align with their branding.\nText posts stand out in a visually saturated feed and are great for offering bite-sized value or sparking conversation with followers.\nHere is an example from Sprout Social:\n\nSoft launches to tease products\nBrands are teasing new products through “soft launch” posts. They are portraying new products with subtle hints, behind-the-scenes peeks or cryptic messages. Usually they are dropping a few posts over a period of time to create anticipation and hype for the launch of new products from those following.\nThis is an excellent strategy for engaging your audience to peak curiosity about what’s coming next. Additionally, creating buzz around a product before its official launch helps generate early interest and demand.\nCheck out how Huda Beauty did this soft launch Reel seamlessly:\n\n2. Empower social content creation with AI\nJust like most other tech brands, Instagram—and its parent company Meta—is investing heavily in AI this year. For marketers, this trend could seriously change the way they create content.\nCurrently, Instagram offers the following AI features for creators in specific regions:\n\nAI generated stickers: Users can enter prompts to create custom AI stickers. From there, they can send those stickers in chats or add them to their stories.\nStart a chat with AI: Ask for recommendations and advice, talk about interests, and even view and follow AI profiles and the content they post.\nAI backdrops for stories: When you share a photo to your story, use the AI backdrop tool to create a new background based on a text prompt.\n\nMark Zuckerburg has also announced two new AI capabilities that might soon come to Instagram—AI image editing and high quality video generation. Users would be able to quickly remove unwanted objects, manipulate images, change the background and generate creative, original video clips that match their vision by simply typing in prompts.\nAside from using Instagram’s built-in AI features, brands are tapping into third-party AI tools to create content quickly and easily. For example, you can use Sprout Social’s AI capabilities to analyze sentiment, share posts at just the right time, write engaging captions, brainstorm campaign ideas, generate competitor reports and personalize support messages.\n\nBut does this mean AI is going to replace social media managers completely? Not anytime soon. It is, however, increasingly becoming a part of social media strategies.\nAI can help marketers slash time in half by automating certain tasks and accelerating creative processes. Used smartly, it can help you scale content creation, improve user experiences, drive more engagement and stay ahead of the competition.\n3. Increase engagement with community experiences\nDriving engagement on Instagram takes more than just a pretty feed. With the algorithm now actively favoring genuine community engagement and interaction, brands need to prioritize building connections with their audiences.\nFor example, Instagram launched broadcast channels last year as a one way messaging tool for creators to engage with their followers. These channels will give creators an opportunity to give the latest updates to their followers in a more intimate and interactive space.\nThis is an example of Quek Shio‘s broadcast channel to get a better understanding of what they look like:\n\nCurrently, creators can send text, photo, video and voice notes in broadcast channels. They can also share question cards and polls to gather fan feedback. However, it’s still unclear whether this feature will expand to business accounts or if it will remain just for digital content creators.\nAlternatively, brands can add followers to their Close Friends list to share exclusive content, stories, offers and updates. Gather feedback, answer questions, share behind-the-scenes footage and even create an exclusive list for customers only.\nInvite people to join your Close Friends list by talking about it in a post or story like Tina Davies Professional.\n4. Increase traffic with multiple links from bio\nRemember the good ol’ link in bio?\nPreviously, you could only add one link to your Instagram profile. Most marketers relied on tools like Linktree to condense all their important channels and pages into a single link.\nNow, you can include up to five external links in your Instagram bio. See Ring Concierge’s Instagram profile to see how they show up when you click into them: \nFor omnichannel brands, this is a huge opportunity to drive traffic to multiple channels and touchpoints. A retail brand could take users to their best selling product page, FAQs section, YouTube channel and online shop. A SaaS brand could send people to their highest converting landing page, latest blog post and a new downloadable eBook.\nHere’s how to add multiple links to your bio:\n\nOpen the Instagram app\nTap on your account\nTap Edit profile under your profile picture\nTap Add links\nTap + Add external link\nEnter the URL and title of the link you want to add\nHit Done in the top right corner\nTap + Add external link again to add another link\n\nYou can also delete links and/or change them anytime you want. This offers a lot of flexibility to brands that want to boost new campaigns and content on channels other than Instagram.\n5. Boost visibility using Instagram SEO\nSocial search is a rapidly growing trend. Last year, a combined 29% of Gen Z and Millennials flocked to social media platforms instead of actual search engines to find information. And this number continues to grow in 2024.\nOptimizing for native search is more important than ever. Instagram’s algorithm is working constantly to deliver relevant, personalized and intent based content to users’ feeds. To stand out, marketers need an Instagram SEO strategy that goes beyond just using the right hashtags.\nHere are some tips to help your Instagram content rank higher in Explore and user feeds:\n\nFind the right keywords: Pinpoint specific keywords your audience is searching for to guide your content creation strategy. For instance, if there’s a rising interest in vegan recipes, create content around keywords like “vegan breakfast ideas” or “plant-based dinners.”\nOptimize subtitles and captions: Incorporate keywords into the text part of your Instagram posts and stories. Use them in subtitles, captions, tags and stickers. Don’t forget to keep it engaging. You could start with a question like “Who else loves smoothie bowls?” to prompt user engagement and include keywords naturally.\nFollow and engage with similar accounts: Actively comment on and like posts from accounts in your niche, such as other vegan food bloggers, to increase visibility and encourage cross-engagement.\nAdd alt text to your posts: Adding descriptive alt text to images, like “vegan avocado toast on a rustic table,” improves your post’s accessibility and helps Instagram’s algorithm understand and categorize your content better.\nHop on the latest trends: Stay updated with viral hashtags or challenges and incorporate them when relevant. If #Veganuary is trending, join the conversation by sharing your unique vegan recipes or tips.\nStick to the official guidelines: Ensure your content follows Instagram’s recommendation guidelines to boost its chances of ranking higher in feeds and showing up in front of the right audiences.\n\n6. Create brand partnerships with native Instagram tools\nInstagram has long been the top platform for brands and influencers to work together. It’s easy to see why—consumers are 1.5x more likely to be interested in viewing branded creator content on Instagram than on other platforms.\nIn 2024, Instagram is taking brand collaborations more seriously than ever. They’ve already introduced a bunch of tools and features to facilitate these partnerships.\nFor example, brands can allow other Instagram accounts, such as influencers or partners, to add product tags in their posts. Users who click on these tags will be taken directly to the brand’s Instagram shop and would be able to check out on the platform.\nBrands can also share collaborative posts with partners and influencers. Users can “invite collaborators” to a post as well as tag brands in paid partnerships, having both involved accounts show up—and publishing the post to both collaborators’ profiles.\nTo see what they look like, check out this collaborative post done by food blogger, Appetite Foodie, and Bang Bang Oriental, a food hall in London:\n\nBut perhaps the most exciting update is the launch of Instagram’s Creator Marketplace. It’s kind of like Instagram’s own influencer management platform where brands can find creators to work with, share campaign ideas and structured outlines with them, manage communication, discuss compensation and more all in one place.\n\nImage Source: Instagram\nCreator Marketplace is currently only available to brands in the US. Businesses interested in joining the marketplace can fill out this form.\n7. Food content is trending on Instagram\nIf you’ve been on Instagram for a while, you know food content is big on the platform. We’re not just talking beautiful, mouthwatering photos of food. This year, it’s also about quick, easy and healthy recipes and Reels users can’t stop watching.\nAnd it makes sense. Most people on Instagram are 18-34 years old—an age group that significantly contributes to food culture online. On top of that, Gen Z isn’t afraid of what’s trending on the plate. In fact, they’re fascinated by it. A notable 45% are intrigued by vegan products, while 42% are willing to try plant based meat.\nPlus, when you look at larger societal shifts towards saving money as well as health, wellness and mindful eating, it’s easy to see why users want more content about making and consuming restaurant quality food at home.\nFor food and restaurant brands, this presents a major opportunity on Instagram. Get creative with easy-to-follow recipe tutorials, cooking tips or mouthwatering food styling Reels. Go live while preparing customer favorites or spotlighting local farms that supply your ingredients.\nHere is an example of how The Baker’s Grove in New Jersey did it well:\n\nThese bites of food content, especially when optimized with Instagram hashtags and captions that spark conversation, can drive huge visibility for your business.\nNot just for restaurants, brands selling kitchenware, meal services, courses and more can all capitalize on users’ cravings for cooking inspiration. Show how your product can help them elevate homemade meals or present enticing close-ups of dishes your item helped prepare.\nEven brands in unrelated verticals should incorporate food content when possible. Take this example from IKEA:\n\nThere are opportunities to spotlight office kitchen areas or cafes. Show your team enjoying meals prepared by featured vendors. Genuinely connect with audiences over universal topics like favorite comfort foods or go to late night snacks.\nFood has exceptional power to build strong, personal connections. Find creative ways to incorporate food content into your Instagram strategy while keeping it relevant to position your brand for growth in 2024.\n8. Leverage user generated content\nUser-generated content (UGC) currently dominates Instagram—for good reason. Hard selling promotional tactics don’t work anymore. People now crave authenticity and relatability, especially on a platform they’re spending hours on daily.\nAnd the strongest brands tap into this free marketing by creatively repurposing posts from real customers. It’s the most powerful way to build trust, drive engagement and grow on the platform.\nSo, how do you get your hands on quality Instagram UGC?\nBig brands like BMW, Samsung and Apple use hashtags to source user-generated content.\n\n#shotoniphone has 29.6 million posts\n#bmwrepost has 2.8 million posts\n#withgalaxy has 1.9 million posts\n\nSamsung has even created a separate Instagram account to showcase UGC. Creators looking to get some exposure on the platform gladly tag photos taken with their Samsung devices with #withGalaxy for a chance to be featured on the brand’s page—which has an impressive following of 4.8 million users.\n\nAnother way to encourage UGC is to run competitions and reward the best entry or entries. Or, partner with influencers and creators in your niche. Ask them to share honest product reviews or send them free PR packages to create unboxing videos you can repost on your brand’s page.\nJake the Bengal, the cat influencer, and Cheerble, the Pet Store, created a collaborative paid partnership post to advertise Cheerble’s cat toy.\n\nYou can ask permission to repost organic stories and posts featuring your product from non influencer public accounts. These are highly effective as they show genuinely happy customers using your brand in their day-to-day lives.\n9. Paid promotions expand your reach\nAs the popularity of social media platforms grows, the need for algorithms to best serve their users also grows. And when an algorithm is deciding who gets served your content, you might see a decline in reach. Because of this, Instagram paid promotions are a growing trend in 2024.\nLet’s go back to our exercise from the first trend, where we scrolled down to see the first 10 to 20 posts.\nIf your feed was anything like mine, you saw about nine Reels, six regular posts and five sponsored posts. That means about 25% of your feed is filled with paid ads, like the Deel one below.\n\nWhile that might seem like a lot, let’s look at it from a different perspective. It also means that 25% of your target audience’s feed is filled with sponsored posts. And that if you start investing in Instagram ads, your brand can own part of that 25%.\nUse Instagram trends to update your strategy\nThousands of factors influence Instagram trends—other platforms, new features, consumer behavior and societal shifts are just a few. Keeping up with the current trends on Instagram freshens up your content and shows your audience you’re not afraid to try new things.\nLooking to level up your Instagram marketing in 2024?

 Tool Ask question to co-worker accepts these inputs: Ask question to co-worker(question: str, context: str, coworker: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs) - Ask a specific question to one of the following co-workers: [Instagram Market Researcher
, Instagram Copywriter

The input to this tool should be the co-worker, the question you have for them, and ALL necessary context to ask the question properly, they know nothing about the question, so share absolute everything you know, don't reference things but instead explain them.

However, if you keep up with the latest Instagram trends, you can leverage these trends as part of your Instagram marketing strategy that grabs attention and fuels growth.\nIn this article, we dive deep into the top nine Instagram trends for 2024. We’ll cover innovative tactics like AI-driven content creation and community building with examples to incorporate them into your own Instagram strategy.\n1. Video takes priority over images\nDo me a favor: Open your Instagram app and scroll through the first 10 to 15 pieces of content. As you scroll, you might notice a common theme—most of the posts are videos.\nInstagram continues to prioritize video—specifically Reels—in 2024. In fact, the platform is regularly releasing new features to encourage creators to make more video content.\nFor example, you can now:\n\nReply to a Reel with another Reel\nAdd new effects, music and voice overs to your Reels\nUpload video stories up to 60 seconds long with no cuts\nHost interactive live streams\n\nLeaning hard into video isn’t just encouraged at this point—it’s essential to thrive on Instagram right now. Convey your brand’s authentic personality. Show your products in action. Give behind-the-scenes glimpses of your team. Talk to your followers in real-time.\nUsing video not only helps you build genuine connections with your audience—it also drives reach and engagement by appealing to the Instagram algorithm.\nInstagram Reel trends for 2024\nInstagram Reels launched in 2020 and slowly rolled out to all users throughout 2021. This micro video addition to Instagram was created to compete with Snapchat and TikTok. It has continued to grow in popularity. Many brands and content creators will repurpose their videos across each of the platforms—TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.\nHere are some Instagram Reel trends popular with brands this year:\nSocial media managers acting as brand spokespeople\nInstead of hiring paid actors to deliver scripted messages, social media managers are now stepping in front of the camera when creating Reels.\nSocial media managers have an intimate understanding of the brand’s voice and values. And they’re able to quickly create content that deeply resonates with the audience at a fraction of the cost. Our social media managers here at Sprout Social hop into Reels from time to time to act as spokespeople for our social media marketing software:\n\nAn added bonus to this is that social media managers’ appearances help build stronger personal connections between the brand and its customers over time.\nVideo memes\nMemes, of course, still are trending on Instagram. Brands are remixing meme Reels with trending audio and putting their own spin on funny clips or pop culture references to be relevant to their brand and audience like Visme did.\n\nRemember to align your meme content with brand values while still showing the lighter side of your business. When done right, it can get lots of positive engagement when you’re conscious to position your brand as relatable and culturally aware.\nInstagram post trends for 2024\nJust because Reels are trending on Instagram doesn’t mean static posts are dead. If you look at your feed, a good 25-30% is likely still are image, video and carousel posts.\nInstagram has also rolled out a small but decent update in this area. You can now add audio to static posts to make them more engaging.\nBrands continue to use Instagram posts in unique, creative ways. Here are some noteworthy trends to watch and try this year:\nPhoto dump\nThis Instagram post trend is specific to carousels. The photo dump involves sharing a series of images that may seem candid and unrelated at first glance but collectively convey a story or a theme.\nIt’s like flipping through someone’s personal photo album. It offers a glimpse into behind-the-scenes moments. For brands, these moments could include events, user-generated content and photoshoots. For example, Coach used this trend to showcase their fashion collection for Fall 2024.\nText posts\nTraditionally, Instagram has been all about the visuals. However, at the moment, there’s a growing trend of text posts. The theme is to make the text post a static image or flip-through series within a carousel.\nBrands are posting stats, listicles, tips, how-tos, quotes, announcements, customer testimonials and more as aesthetically pleasing, minimalistic text posts that align with their branding.\nText posts stand out in a visually saturated feed and are great for offering bite-sized value or sparking conversation with followers.\nHere is an example from Sprout Social:\n\nSoft launches to tease products\nBrands are teasing new products through “soft launch” posts. They are portraying new products with subtle hints, behind-the-scenes peeks or cryptic messages. Usually they are dropping a few posts over a period of time to create anticipation and hype for the launch of new products from those following.\nThis is an excellent strategy for engaging your audience to peak curiosity about what’s coming next. Additionally, creating buzz around a product before its official launch helps generate early interest and demand.\nCheck out how Huda Beauty did this soft launch Reel seamlessly:\n\n2. Empower social content creation with AI\nJust like most other tech brands, Instagram—and its parent company Meta—is investing heavily in AI this year. For marketers, this trend could seriously change the way they create content.\nCurrently, Instagram offers the following AI features for creators in specific regions:\n\nAI generated stickers: Users can enter prompts to create custom AI stickers. From there, they can send those stickers in chats or add them to their stories.\nStart a chat with AI: Ask for recommendations and advice, talk about interests, and even view and follow AI profiles and the content they post.\nAI backdrops for stories: When you share a photo to your story, use the AI backdrop tool to create a new background based on a text prompt.\n\nMark Zuckerburg has also announced two new AI capabilities that might soon come to Instagram—AI image editing and high quality video generation. Users would be able to quickly remove unwanted objects, manipulate images, change the background and generate creative, original video clips that match their vision by simply typing in prompts.\nAside from using Instagram’s built-in AI features, brands are tapping into third-party AI tools to create content quickly and easily. For example, you can use Sprout Social’s AI capabilities to analyze sentiment, share posts at just the right time, write engaging captions, brainstorm campaign ideas, generate competitor reports and personalize support messages.\n\nBut does this mean AI is going to replace social media managers completely? Not anytime soon. It is, however, increasingly becoming a part of social media strategies.\nAI can help marketers slash time in half by automating certain tasks and accelerating creative processes. Used smartly, it can help you scale content creation, improve user experiences, drive more engagement and stay ahead of the competition.\n3. Increase engagement with community experiences\nDriving engagement on Instagram takes more than just a pretty feed. With the algorithm now actively favoring genuine community engagement and interaction, brands need to prioritize building connections with their audiences.\nFor example, Instagram launched broadcast channels last year as a one way messaging tool for creators to engage with their followers. These channels will give creators an opportunity to give the latest updates to their followers in a more intimate and interactive space.\nThis is an example of Quek Shio‘s broadcast channel to get a better understanding of what they look like:\n\nCurrently, creators can send text, photo, video and voice notes in broadcast channels. They can also share question cards and polls to gather fan feedback. However, it’s still unclear whether this feature will expand to business accounts or if it will remain just for digital content creators.\nAlternatively, brands can add followers to their Close Friends list to share exclusive content, stories, offers and updates. Gather feedback, answer questions, share behind-the-scenes footage and even create an exclusive list for customers only.\nInvite people to join your Close Friends list by talking about it in a post or story like Tina Davies Professional.\n4. Increase traffic with multiple links from bio\nRemember the good ol’ link in bio?\nPreviously, you could only add one link to your Instagram profile. Most marketers relied on tools like Linktree to condense all their important channels and pages into a single link.\nNow, you can include up to five external links in your Instagram bio. See Ring Concierge’s Instagram profile to see how they show up when you click into them: \nFor omnichannel brands, this is a huge opportunity to drive traffic to multiple channels and touchpoints. A retail brand could take users to their best selling product page, FAQs section, YouTube channel and online shop. A SaaS brand could send people to their highest converting landing page, latest blog post and a new downloadable eBook.\nHere’s how to add multiple links to your bio:\n\nOpen the Instagram app\nTap on your account\nTap Edit profile under your profile picture\nTap Add links\nTap + Add external link\nEnter the URL and title of the link you want to add\nHit Done in the top right corner\nTap + Add external link again to add another link\n\nYou can also delete links and/or change them anytime you want. This offers a lot of flexibility to brands that want to boost new campaigns and content on channels other than Instagram.\n5. Boost visibility using Instagram SEO\nSocial search is a rapidly growing trend. Last year, a combined 29% of Gen Z and Millennials flocked to social media platforms instead of actual search engines to find information. And this number continues to grow in 2024.\nOptimizing for native search is more important than ever. Instagram’s algorithm is working constantly to deliver relevant, personalized and intent based content to users’ feeds. To stand out, marketers need an Instagram SEO strategy that goes beyond just using the right hashtags.\nHere are some tips to help your Instagram content rank higher in Explore and user feeds:\n\nFind the right keywords: Pinpoint specific keywords your audience is searching for to guide your content creation strategy. For instance, if there’s a rising interest in vegan recipes, create content around keywords like “vegan breakfast ideas” or “plant-based dinners.”\nOptimize subtitles and captions: Incorporate keywords into the text part of your Instagram posts and stories. Use them in subtitles, captions, tags and stickers. Don’t forget to keep it engaging. You could start with a question like “Who else loves smoothie bowls?” to prompt user engagement and include keywords naturally.\nFollow and engage with similar accounts: Actively comment on and like posts from accounts in your niche, such as other vegan food bloggers, to increase visibility and encourage cross-engagement.\nAdd alt text to your posts: Adding descriptive alt text to images, like “vegan avocado toast on a rustic table,” improves your post’s accessibility and helps Instagram’s algorithm understand and categorize your content better.\nHop on the latest trends: Stay updated with viral hashtags or challenges and incorporate them when relevant. If #Veganuary is trending, join the conversation by sharing your unique vegan recipes or tips.\nStick to the official guidelines: Ensure your content follows Instagram’s recommendation guidelines to boost its chances of ranking higher in feeds and showing up in front of the right audiences.\n\n6. Create brand partnerships with native Instagram tools\nInstagram has long been the top platform for brands and influencers to work together. It’s easy to see why—consumers are 1.5x more likely to be interested in viewing branded creator content on Instagram than on other platforms.\nIn 2024, Instagram is taking brand collaborations more seriously than ever. They’ve already introduced a bunch of tools and features to facilitate these partnerships.\nFor example, brands can allow other Instagram accounts, such as influencers or partners, to add product tags in their posts. Users who click on these tags will be taken directly to the brand’s Instagram shop and would be able to check out on the platform.\nBrands can also share collaborative posts with partners and influencers. Users can “invite collaborators” to a post as well as tag brands in paid partnerships, having both involved accounts show up—and publishing the post to both collaborators’ profiles.\nTo see what they look like, check out this collaborative post done by food blogger, Appetite Foodie, and Bang Bang Oriental, a food hall in London:\n\nBut perhaps the most exciting update is the launch of Instagram’s Creator Marketplace. It’s kind of like Instagram’s own influencer management platform where brands can find creators to work with, share campaign ideas and structured outlines with them, manage communication, discuss compensation and more all in one place.\n\nImage Source: Instagram\nCreator Marketplace is currently only available to brands in the US. Businesses interested in joining the marketplace can fill out this form.\n7. Food content is trending on Instagram\nIf you’ve been on Instagram for a while, you know food content is big on the platform. We’re not just talking beautiful, mouthwatering photos of food. This year, it’s also about quick, easy and healthy recipes and Reels users can’t stop watching.\nAnd it makes sense. Most people on Instagram are 18-34 years old—an age group that significantly contributes to food culture online. On top of that, Gen Z isn’t afraid of what’s trending on the plate. In fact, they’re fascinated by it. A notable 45% are intrigued by vegan products, while 42% are willing to try plant based meat.\nPlus, when you look at larger societal shifts towards saving money as well as health, wellness and mindful eating, it’s easy to see why users want more content about making and consuming restaurant quality food at home.\nFor food and restaurant brands, this presents a major opportunity on Instagram. Get creative with easy-to-follow recipe tutorials, cooking tips or mouthwatering food styling Reels. Go live while preparing customer favorites or spotlighting local farms that supply your ingredients.\nHere is an example of how The Baker’s Grove in New Jersey did it well:\n\nThese bites of food content, especially when optimized with Instagram hashtags and captions that spark conversation, can drive huge visibility for your business.\nNot just for restaurants, brands selling kitchenware, meal services, courses and more can all capitalize on users’ cravings for cooking inspiration. Show how your product can help them elevate homemade meals or present enticing close-ups of dishes your item helped prepare.\nEven brands in unrelated verticals should incorporate food content when possible. Take this example from IKEA:\n\nThere are opportunities to spotlight office kitchen areas or cafes. Show your team enjoying meals prepared by featured vendors. Genuinely connect with audiences over universal topics like favorite comfort foods or go to late night snacks.\nFood has exceptional power to build strong, personal connections. Find creative ways to incorporate food content into your Instagram strategy while keeping it relevant to position your brand for growth in 2024.\n8. Leverage user generated content\nUser-generated content (UGC) currently dominates Instagram—for good reason. Hard selling promotional tactics don’t work anymore. People now crave authenticity and relatability, especially on a platform they’re spending hours on daily.\nAnd the strongest brands tap into this free marketing by creatively repurposing posts from real customers. It’s the most powerful way to build trust, drive engagement and grow on the platform.\nSo, how do you get your hands on quality Instagram UGC?\nBig brands like BMW, Samsung and Apple use hashtags to source user-generated content.\n\n#shotoniphone has 29.6 million posts\n#bmwrepost has 2.8 million posts\n#withgalaxy has 1.9 million posts\n\nSamsung has even created a separate Instagram account to showcase UGC. Creators looking to get some exposure on the platform gladly tag photos taken with their Samsung devices with #withGalaxy for a chance to be featured on the brand’s page—which has an impressive following of 4.8 million users.\n\nAnother way to encourage UGC is to run competitions and reward the best entry or entries. Or, partner with influencers and creators in your niche. Ask them to share honest product reviews or send them free PR packages to create unboxing videos you can repost on your brand’s page.\nJake the Bengal, the cat influencer, and Cheerble, the Pet Store, created a collaborative paid partnership post to advertise Cheerble’s cat toy.\n\nYou can ask permission to repost organic stories and posts featuring your product from non influencer public accounts. These are highly effective as they show genuinely happy customers using your brand in their day-to-day lives.\n9. Paid promotions expand your reach\nAs the popularity of social media platforms grows, the need for algorithms to best serve their users also grows. And when an algorithm is deciding who gets served your content, you might see a decline in reach. Because of this, Instagram paid promotions are a growing trend in 2024.\nLet’s go back to our exercise from the first trend, where we scrolled down to see the first 10 to 20 posts.\nIf your feed was anything like mine, you saw about nine Reels, six regular posts and five sponsored posts. That means about 25% of your feed is filled with paid ads, like the Deel one below.\n\nWhile that might seem like a lot, let’s look at it from a different perspective. It also means that 25% of your target audience’s feed is filled with sponsored posts. And that if you start investing in Instagram ads, your brand can own part of that 25%.\nUse Instagram trends to update your strategy\nThousands of factors influence Instagram trends—other platforms, new features, consumer behavior and societal shifts are just a few. Keeping up with the current trends on Instagram freshens up your content and shows your audience you’re not afraid to try new things.\nLooking to level up your Instagram marketing in 2024?

This page contains lots of useful information about the latest trends on Instagram. I have observed the following key trends:

1. Video takes priority over images - Instagram is prioritizing video content, specifically Reels.
2. Empower social content creation with AI - Instagram is investing heavily in AI to aid content creation. 
3. Increase engagement with community experiences - Broadcast channels and adding followers to Close Friends list for exclusive content is a trend. 
4. Increase traffic with multiple links from bio - Instagram now allows up to 5 external links in a user's bio. 
5. Boost visibility using Instagram SEO - More users are searching for information on social media platforms, so optimizing for native search is important.
6. Create brand partnerships with native Instagram tools - Instagram is facilitating brand collaborations with new tools and features.
7. Food content is trending on Instagram - Food content, including healthy recipes and reels, is popular.
8. Leverage user generated content - Brands are using user-generated content to build trust and engagement.
9. Paid promotions expand your reach - Paid promotions are becoming more prevalent as reach on social media platforms becomes more algorithm-driven.

Now, I will search for the optimal posting times.

Tell me more! At the forefront of social media since 2010, Instagram has become not only a staple in our phones’ app libraries but also in our everyday lives. With\xa0more than 2 billion active users this fall, the social media giant’s popularity is projected to grow to even greater heights over the coming year. Hoffmann Murtaugh has the exclusive insights every social media marketer needs to know about the Instagram trend forecast for 2022.\xa0Get Ready For A Ride On The Carousel, The Latest Instagram Trend!Instagram users rejoice in knowing that their ‘weekly photo dumps’ aren’t going anywhere in 2022! While the emerging Instagram trend of sharing a user’s top 10 photos to summarize their week is typically for fun, the feature also can positively impact a brand’s marketing strategy. With more content for Instagram users to scroll through and engage within a carousel, consumers are spending more time looking at a brand’s post, and ultimately, at a brand’s Instagram page overall. Plan on seeing more tailored, curated Instagram carousel posts as we head into the new year.\xa0Enhanced Instagram Shopping User ExperienceWhether avoidance of COVID-19 pandemic surges or new habits that have been formed, online shopping is huge. In fact, 54 percent of consumers prefer to shop online. Expect Instagram Shopping to take off in 2022 as more brands become acquainted with the digital storefront feature. Seamlessly and organically integrated within the app, Instagram takes consumers through the entire purchasing experience. Businesses can maximize their sales to broader audiences by exploring all Instagram Shopping has to offer in 2022.\xa0The Continued Rise Of Influencer MarketingHave you purchased a product from someone’s Instagram recommendation? Instagram has been a pioneer in providing a platform for users to follow people whose lifestyles, fashion, fitness, advice, piques their interest and inspiration. As social media influencers gain traction and develop their own communities on Instagram, brands are taking notice. Brands need to start investing in paid partnerships with Instagram users relevant to their target audience. 2022 will expose the full potential of influencers (of all account sizes) in amplifying a brand’s social media marketing efforts.\xa0Gen Z Has Entered The ChatSpeaking of influence—let’s talk about some of the youngest Instagram users driving the incoming trends to fleeting success. Making up approximately 20 percent of the population, Generation Z (those born between 1997-2012) Instagram users have utilized many of the social media network’s unique features to share creative, engaging content with friends, families, and classmates. In a current world of remote learning and limited social gatherings, Instagram allows Gen Z to make up fun dances on Reels, share their music favorites on Stories, and thrifted finds from Shopping. Not only does this generation make use of Instagram’s capabilities, but Gen Z also sparks a conversation for social change. These young users encourage their favorite brands to stand up for causes that matter most to them. Don’t underestimate the power of Gen Z and how they will reshape the narrative on brands on Instagram in 2022.Which Instagram trend from 2021 was your favorite?

time to post on Instagram. Instagram’s visual nature makes it a desirable marketing platform for brands to get their offerings in front of as many eyes as possible, and knowing the best times to post on Instagram can be a major benefit to your social media strategy.\nRemember: with Instagram as a discovery platform of trends, brands, products or services, it’s important to get high-quality photos and content in front of potential consumers’ eyes at the right time.\nLearn how to identify your best times to post on Instagram with a free trial of Sprout Social and test our ViralPost® feature.\nStart a free Sprout Social trial\nDisclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded globally (not by Central Time), meaning you should be able to publish with the times provided in any timezone and see positive engagement results. Number of engagements represents total engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level engagement times. We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in 2024?\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\n\nWhen are the best times to post Reels on Instagram?\nAre the best times to post on Instagram different for static posts versus Reels? Perhaps there’s a definitive answer to that question, however, our data source is inclusive of posts, Stories and Reels. The information in this article should guide you to uncover the best times to post any content on Instagram to see positive engagement, whether it’s a static post, a Story with polls or a creative Reel.\nThe best times to post Reels on Instagram will be similar to our data above: weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. Our optimal send time data for Instagram is aggregate for Posts, Reels and Stories – both images and videos.\nFor that reason, we recommend you test posting Reels at different times to uncover the highest engagement times for you. Keep in mind that several factors go into Reels’ performance, whether it’s using trending sounds, the Instagram algorithm or having an engaging video hook to capture your audience’s attention.\n\n\nWhat is the best day and time to post on Instagram?\nWe know the best time to post on Instagram overall, but what about for each day of the week? If you’re looking for the best day and time to post on Instagram, read the analysis below.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Monday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Mondays is from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. While there’s decent engagement from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., optimal send and engagement times are those few hours during a typical lunch break.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Tuesday\nThere’s nearly double the highest engagement times on Tuesdays than there are on Mondays.

Taking this into account, the best time to post on Saturday is 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 10 am to 12 p.m. on Sundays.

So instead of covering specific trends that might be out of date by the time we finish typing this sentence, we’re going to cover broader trends and cite some current examples.\n\n\n\n\nGet our 2024 Social Trends report, and dig into the juicy data that’ll help you reach your goals in 2024—which is shaping up to be social’s best year yet.\n\n\n\n11 most important 2024 Instagram trends\n1. Challenges continue to rule on Reels\nTrending challenges embrace a lighter side of social media, and foster a sense of community among Instagram users. Dance challenges, exercise challenges, riddles and other popular tests of strength or smarts are virtually always circulating on the platform: take a scroll through your Reels and you’re sure to come across them.\nFor example, right now there’s a challenge going around where folks ask their friends, family or coworkers to try and jump without bending their knees.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by BuzzFeed (@buzzfeed)\n\n\n\nChallenges can also be posed from the poster to the audience—for instance, in “guess who’s singing” challenges, users can reply in the comments with their guesses.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by A Cappella Academy | 501(c)(3) (@acappellacademy)\n\n\n\nThe “Roman empire” trend could also be considered a challenge, where users ask men in their lives how often they think about the Roman empire…\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lex nicoleta (@lex_nicoleta)\n\n\n\n… with varying results.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Calum Worthy (@calumworthy)\n\n\n\n2. Replying with Reels creates conversations\nInstagram took a note from TikTok and introduced “reply Reels” to give creators and brands more opportunities to meaningfully engage with their audiences. When a user leaves a comment on a public Reel, the poster of the Reel can reply to it with another video, creating a dialogue with the commenter.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mike Archangelo (@mikearchangelo)\n\n\n\nSometimes, reply Reels answer questions or draw attention to positive feedback—the video above is answering a question, and is meant for educational purposes. But it’s also common for users to use Reel replies to respond to negative comments… to clap back, if you will.\n3. AI generates new opportunities\nEek, robots are taking over the world — Instagram included. Many IG users are using AI to generate content ideas, write captions and even edit photos and videos.\nAnd that’s fair game! AI can help you painlessly fill up your content calendar. Just remember: you’re still the brains of the operation. Don’t take AI-generated posts and ideas at face value. Make edits when necessary to make sure that everything that goes live is aligned with your goals and brand guidelines.\nHootsuite, for example, has Owlywriter AI for instant captions, repurposing past content and coming up with fresh campaigns. Sign up for a free 30-day trial to check it out!\n\n4. Photo dumps keep it real\nAn Instagram photo dump is a collection of images posted in a carousel (sidenote: Instagram carousel posts, on average, get three times as much engagement as a single feed photo post does). Photo dumps generally include a variety of different kinds of images and also a variety of image qualities.\nPhoto dumps are evidence of a movement away from the polished, edited, filtered content that Instagram has become known for. Photo dumps are a more casual and honest representation of the way we actually live: blurry photos, messy spaces and screenshots of memes are the usual suspects in a standard dump.\nFor excellent examples of photo dumps, look no further than Gen Z celebrities: they’ve created an art form.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter)\n\n\n\n5. Text posts thrive on the ‘gram\nInstagram is, first and foremost, a photo- and video-sharing app… right? That may be true, but the definition of a photo or video continues to be blurred by social media. Think about collections of memes, or screenshots of Tweets (which are now just called posts, we guess, since Twitter rebranded as X).\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CwgK6PzM-GN/\nGorgeous, high-resolution photos will always be winners on Instagram, but text posts are trending, too. A simple note or relatable screengrab is super sharable, and continues to be a low-maintenance minefield of content.\nPro tip: if you’re posting text-based images on Instagram, make sure you’re making them accessible. Not everyone is able to use vision to take in information, and you want your content to reach as many people as possible. Use the alt text field to type out the words in your post so that everyone can read them.\n6. The future of Threads is uncertain\nThis is in contrast to the point above: while text does well on Instagram, IG’s text-based offshoot isn’t exactly thriving.\nMeta introduced Threads, a text-based “update” app, in summer 2023. Threads uses the same login info as Instagram, meaning that if you already have an IG account, you’ve got a Threads account, too — it’s just waiting for you to sign in.\nWhen it comes down to it, the best way to describe Threads is “like Twitter” or “like X, the app formerly known as Twitter.” It’s certainly intended as a direct competitor. At first, it seemed like threads might actually be the new tweets, but as news outlets report that Threads daily active user numbers are falling, the future isn’t clear.\nThe takeaway? Using Threads is an excellent way to enhance your social presence, but now’s probably not the time to invest all of your resources into that one platform.\n7. Working together with Instagram collab posts\nNot only are Instagram collab posts used as engagement announcements by every annoying person you went to high school with — they’re also super helpful for business partnerships. Instagram collab posts allow for two or more accounts to post the same content and share the likes, comments and other engagement-boosting analytics.\nFor example, take this collab post with Lululemon, Peloton and several influential fitness creators: it has 36 thousand likes and over 800 comments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lululemon (@lululemon)\n\n\n\nPosting in collaboration with another user automatically expands your reach. It gives you the opportunity to be seen by not only your followers, but by your collaborator’s followers as well.\nCollab posts are great for relationship-building (in marketing and in life) and often produce win-win results for both parties.\n8. Driving traffic with a link in bio\nThere’s lots of ways to make money on Instagram, but most of them involve making money indirectly. In other words, Instagram isn’t paying you, it’s just a tool you use to guide consumers towards your business. To actually convert your IG audience into paying customers, you’ll need to use your link in bio.\nTake this post from Bon Appetit, for example. Instead of posting the recipe, the Instagram post is used to direct audiences to the company’s website (which, in turn, directs them to signing up for a paid subscription).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by bonappetitmag (@bonappetitmag)\n\n\n\nCreators use their link in bio to direct followers to their online store or Youtube page, retailers use it to direct people to their ecommerce platform, actors use it to link to upcoming projects. It’s a super-diverse, super-useful part of Instagram, and if you’re not using it, this is your sign.\n9. Music, music everywhere\nYou can’t hear a photo, right? Wrong — at least, that’s not the case on Instagram anymore. Now, you can add audio to your still photos and carousels, which helps to boost how engaging your content is.\nThat means you can now add music to your Reels, Instagram stories and your posts: you can’t stop the beat. As videos become more and more prominent on the platform, creators are looking for ways to make their photos more captivating, and adding music is a free and easy way to boost a still image’s wow-factor.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Universal Music Ireland (@universalmusicireland)\n\n\n\n(Unfortunately, music isn’t actually everywhere—still photos posted with audio can only be heard using Instagram’s mobile app, so if you’re reading this on a computer, the embedded post above won’t look like it has audio. You’ll have to open it on the app to prove it. Alternatively, you can hum a tune yourself.)\n10. Eating around the world\nAccording to Meta’s 2023 Instagram trends report, 68% of Gen Z social media users “will either continue or would like to try food from another culture after discovering it online.”\nFood has always had a huge presence on IG, but modern, younger foodies are more curious and open to trying new foods from other parts of the world.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Maangchi (@maangchi)\n\n\n\nMaangchi’s Korean cooking videos are popular worldwide, and her comments are flooded with folks who are grateful for her lessons on authentic Korean techniques.\n11. Soft launches aren’t just for relationships\nOn Instagram, you may know a “soft launch” as a way for people to hint at a new relationship in their life—rather than showing full commitment by posting a full-face photo of a new partner on their grid, folks are teasing the concept of a new boo by posting blurry or partially hidden pics on their story.\nAnd brands are doing it, too: teasing new products, concepts or services through soft launches on the ‘gram. It’s a way to hype up the news and create some buzz around the brand (similar to how a soft launch of your new boyfriend hopefully will instigate some gossip).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mejuri (@mejuri)\n\n\n\nHere’s an example from jewelry brand Mejuri. The business posted several videos leading up to a sale, and encouraged followers to sign up for a membership to get early access to the deals. Instead of giving away all of the information at once, they’re creating an exclusive opportunity and a bit of mystery.\nTrending Instagram hashtags\nTLDR: Instagram doesn’t publish a list of trending hashtags. So, we had to do some digging.\nThe best Instagram hashtags for you will depend on your specific niche, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for hashtagging on Instagram.\nPlus, using the most popular hashtags doesn’t necessarily mean your post will be successful: #love has been used more than two billion times, meaning that finding a specific post by searching that tag would be basically impossible.\nSo, let’s use an example: say I’m a baker from Vancouver posting some vegan chocolate chip cookies.\nHootsuite has a free hashtag generator to help you come up with ideas—once I type in a description and some keywords…\n\n… some great hashtags are generated for me.\n\nYou can also use the autocomplete on the explore page to come up with ideas–for example, this is what comes up when I start typing “vegan.”\n\nUsing Hootsuite’s social listening technology can also help to identify trending hashtags in your industry (start listening here).\nTrending audio on Instagram\nTrending audio is a little easier to find than trending hashtags, because audio is less niche-specific… but, audio trends change daily. What’s trending on Instagram at the time this post is written might not be trending at the time you’re reading it. So, instead of letting you know what’s’ trending as of the date this blog post is published (it’s “Stick Season”), here are some ways to find what audio is trending, well, now.\nTo find trending audio for an Instagram Reel, open the Instagram Reel editor and tap the music icon. From there, Instagram will show you music it thinks you’ll like. Any song with the “up” arrow next to it is trending upward.\n\nSource: Instagram\nWhen you’re watching Reels, you can also identify if the audio is trending by that arrow—it’s located in the bottom left of the screen.\n\nSource: Instagram\nIf you have more questions about Instagram audio, chances are we’ve answered them here.\nHow to identify and keep up with the latest Instagram trends\nBecause Instagram marketing trends are (literally) always changing and evolving, it’s important to develop strategies to keep up. Here are some hacks for staying in the game.\nRead a social media blog (like Hootsuite)\nWow, genius! You’re already doing it. Hootsuite — and other blogs like it, but come on, we’re the best — keeps up with social trends, conducts social media experiments and gathers useful information all in one spot. Follow social marketing platforms, subscribe to newsletters and check in often.\nFollow Instagram… on Instagram\nAnother no-brainer. Follow Instagram, Meta, and Adam Mosseri on IG, Linkedin, Threads and the platform formerly known as Twitter to stay up to date with new features—new technology often leads to new trends.\nUse the Explore page\nInstagram’s Explore page shows posts that the platform thinks you’ll like, but it’s also a great place to see what topics are on the rise. Just hit the “Search” field and the app will show you a bunch of subjects that are trending. Scroll to the left for more.\nFor example, at the moment this blog post is being written, topics like “pause challenge,” “christmas tree decoration,” “kitchen interior,” “motivational quotes,” “david beckham,” “short hair” and “pedro pascal” are trending.\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\nManage your Instagram presence alongside your other social channels and save time using Hootsuite.

time to post on Instagram. Instagram’s visual nature makes it a desirable marketing platform for brands to get their offerings in front of as many eyes as possible, and knowing the best times to post on Instagram can be a major benefit to your social media strategy.\nRemember: with Instagram as a discovery platform of trends, brands, products or services, it’s important to get high-quality photos and content in front of potential consumers’ eyes at the right time.\nLearn how to identify your best times to post on Instagram with a free trial of Sprout Social and test our ViralPost® feature.\nStart a free Sprout Social trial\nDisclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded globally (not by Central Time), meaning you should be able to publish with the times provided in any timezone and see positive engagement results. Number of engagements represents total engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level engagement times. We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in 2024?\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\n\nWhen are the best times to post Reels on Instagram?\nAre the best times to post on Instagram different for static posts versus Reels? Perhaps there’s a definitive answer to that question, however, our data source is inclusive of posts, Stories and Reels. The information in this article should guide you to uncover the best times to post any content on Instagram to see positive engagement, whether it’s a static post, a Story with polls or a creative Reel.\nThe best times to post Reels on Instagram will be similar to our data above: weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. Our optimal send time data for Instagram is aggregate for Posts, Reels and Stories – both images and videos.\nFor that reason, we recommend you test posting Reels at different times to uncover the highest engagement times for you. Keep in mind that several factors go into Reels’ performance, whether it’s using trending sounds, the Instagram algorithm or having an engaging video hook to capture your audience’s attention.\n\n\nWhat is the best day and time to post on Instagram?\nWe know the best time to post on Instagram overall, but what about for each day of the week? If you’re looking for the best day and time to post on Instagram, read the analysis below.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Monday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Mondays is from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. While there’s decent engagement from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., optimal send and engagement times are those few hours during a typical lunch break.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Tuesday\nThere’s nearly double the highest engagement times on Tuesdays than there are on Mondays. The best time to post on Instagram on Tuesdays is from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Wednesday\nWednesdays see the highest engagement periods than any other day of the week, with even the moderately high engagement times spanning more hours than Tuesdays or Thursdays. The best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Thursday\nSimilar to Wednesdays, the best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and again at 2 p.m. The 1 p.m. hour drops slightly in engagement.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Friday\nBy the time users have reached the weekend, peak engagement hours dip; however, the majority of the workday still captures moderate engagement. Yet the best time to post on Instagram on Fridays is at 11 a.m., but can see almost as much engagement the few hours prior and after that peak engagement time.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Saturday\nGenerally speaking, we’ve noticed that Saturdays and Sundays have less engagement during the rest of the week across most social platforms. Even with Instagram, there’s a significant decrease during the weekends than during weekdays. With that in mind, you’ll still see light to average engagement on the app. The best time to post on Instagram on Saturdays is 9 a.m. to noon, in relation to the rest of the day.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Sunday\nSimilar to Saturdays, we’ve noticed Sundays have less engagement throughout the day across most, if not all, social platforms.

Unfortunately, the content from the Instagram blog page is not accessible. I'll have to resort to another source. The Hootsuite blog post seems to be a good alternative as it is known for providing high-quality social media marketing insights.

So instead of covering specific trends that might be out of date by the time we finish typing this sentence, we’re going to cover broader trends and cite some current examples.\n\n\n\n\nGet our 2024 Social Trends report, and dig into the juicy data that’ll help you reach your goals in 2024—which is shaping up to be social’s best year yet.\n\n\n\n11 most important 2024 Instagram trends\n1. Challenges continue to rule on Reels\nTrending challenges embrace a lighter side of social media, and foster a sense of community among Instagram users. Dance challenges, exercise challenges, riddles and other popular tests of strength or smarts are virtually always circulating on the platform: take a scroll through your Reels and you’re sure to come across them.\nFor example, right now there’s a challenge going around where folks ask their friends, family or coworkers to try and jump without bending their knees.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by BuzzFeed (@buzzfeed)\n\n\n\nChallenges can also be posed from the poster to the audience—for instance, in “guess who’s singing” challenges, users can reply in the comments with their guesses.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by A Cappella Academy | 501(c)(3) (@acappellacademy)\n\n\n\nThe “Roman empire” trend could also be considered a challenge, where users ask men in their lives how often they think about the Roman empire…\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lex nicoleta (@lex_nicoleta)\n\n\n\n… with varying results.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Calum Worthy (@calumworthy)\n\n\n\n2. Replying with Reels creates conversations\nInstagram took a note from TikTok and introduced “reply Reels” to give creators and brands more opportunities to meaningfully engage with their audiences. When a user leaves a comment on a public Reel, the poster of the Reel can reply to it with another video, creating a dialogue with the commenter.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mike Archangelo (@mikearchangelo)\n\n\n\nSometimes, reply Reels answer questions or draw attention to positive feedback—the video above is answering a question, and is meant for educational purposes. But it’s also common for users to use Reel replies to respond to negative comments… to clap back, if you will.\n3. AI generates new opportunities\nEek, robots are taking over the world — Instagram included. Many IG users are using AI to generate content ideas, write captions and even edit photos and videos.\nAnd that’s fair game! AI can help you painlessly fill up your content calendar. Just remember: you’re still the brains of the operation. Don’t take AI-generated posts and ideas at face value. Make edits when necessary to make sure that everything that goes live is aligned with your goals and brand guidelines.\nHootsuite, for example, has Owlywriter AI for instant captions, repurposing past content and coming up with fresh campaigns. Sign up for a free 30-day trial to check it out!\n\n4. Photo dumps keep it real\nAn Instagram photo dump is a collection of images posted in a carousel (sidenote: Instagram carousel posts, on average, get three times as much engagement as a single feed photo post does). Photo dumps generally include a variety of different kinds of images and also a variety of image qualities.\nPhoto dumps are evidence of a movement away from the polished, edited, filtered content that Instagram has become known for. Photo dumps are a more casual and honest representation of the way we actually live: blurry photos, messy spaces and screenshots of memes are the usual suspects in a standard dump.\nFor excellent examples of photo dumps, look no further than Gen Z celebrities: they’ve created an art form.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter)\n\n\n\n5. Text posts thrive on the ‘gram\nInstagram is, first and foremost, a photo- and video-sharing app… right? That may be true, but the definition of a photo or video continues to be blurred by social media. Think about collections of memes, or screenshots of Tweets (which are now just called posts, we guess, since Twitter rebranded as X).\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CwgK6PzM-GN/\nGorgeous, high-resolution photos will always be winners on Instagram, but text posts are trending, too. A simple note or relatable screengrab is super sharable, and continues to be a low-maintenance minefield of content.\nPro tip: if you’re posting text-based images on Instagram, make sure you’re making them accessible. Not everyone is able to use vision to take in information, and you want your content to reach as many people as possible. Use the alt text field to type out the words in your post so that everyone can read them.\n6. The future of Threads is uncertain\nThis is in contrast to the point above: while text does well on Instagram, IG’s text-based offshoot isn’t exactly thriving.\nMeta introduced Threads, a text-based “update” app, in summer 2023. Threads uses the same login info as Instagram, meaning that if you already have an IG account, you’ve got a Threads account, too — it’s just waiting for you to sign in.\nWhen it comes down to it, the best way to describe Threads is “like Twitter” or “like X, the app formerly known as Twitter.” It’s certainly intended as a direct competitor. At first, it seemed like threads might actually be the new tweets, but as news outlets report that Threads daily active user numbers are falling, the future isn’t clear.\nThe takeaway? Using Threads is an excellent way to enhance your social presence, but now’s probably not the time to invest all of your resources into that one platform.\n7. Working together with Instagram collab posts\nNot only are Instagram collab posts used as engagement announcements by every annoying person you went to high school with — they’re also super helpful for business partnerships. Instagram collab posts allow for two or more accounts to post the same content and share the likes, comments and other engagement-boosting analytics.\nFor example, take this collab post with Lululemon, Peloton and several influential fitness creators: it has 36 thousand likes and over 800 comments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by lululemon (@lululemon)\n\n\n\nPosting in collaboration with another user automatically expands your reach. It gives you the opportunity to be seen by not only your followers, but by your collaborator’s followers as well.\nCollab posts are great for relationship-building (in marketing and in life) and often produce win-win results for both parties.\n8. Driving traffic with a link in bio\nThere’s lots of ways to make money on Instagram, but most of them involve making money indirectly. In other words, Instagram isn’t paying you, it’s just a tool you use to guide consumers towards your business. To actually convert your IG audience into paying customers, you’ll need to use your link in bio.\nTake this post from Bon Appetit, for example. Instead of posting the recipe, the Instagram post is used to direct audiences to the company’s website (which, in turn, directs them to signing up for a paid subscription).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by bonappetitmag (@bonappetitmag)\n\n\n\nCreators use their link in bio to direct followers to their online store or Youtube page, retailers use it to direct people to their ecommerce platform, actors use it to link to upcoming projects. It’s a super-diverse, super-useful part of Instagram, and if you’re not using it, this is your sign.\n9. Music, music everywhere\nYou can’t hear a photo, right? Wrong — at least, that’s not the case on Instagram anymore. Now, you can add audio to your still photos and carousels, which helps to boost how engaging your content is.\nThat means you can now add music to your Reels, Instagram stories and your posts: you can’t stop the beat. As videos become more and more prominent on the platform, creators are looking for ways to make their photos more captivating, and adding music is a free and easy way to boost a still image’s wow-factor.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Universal Music Ireland (@universalmusicireland)\n\n\n\n(Unfortunately, music isn’t actually everywhere—still photos posted with audio can only be heard using Instagram’s mobile app, so if you’re reading this on a computer, the embedded post above won’t look like it has audio. You’ll have to open it on the app to prove it. Alternatively, you can hum a tune yourself.)\n10. Eating around the world\nAccording to Meta’s 2023 Instagram trends report, 68% of Gen Z social media users “will either continue or would like to try food from another culture after discovering it online.”\nFood has always had a huge presence on IG, but modern, younger foodies are more curious and open to trying new foods from other parts of the world.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Maangchi (@maangchi)\n\n\n\nMaangchi’s Korean cooking videos are popular worldwide, and her comments are flooded with folks who are grateful for her lessons on authentic Korean techniques.\n11. Soft launches aren’t just for relationships\nOn Instagram, you may know a “soft launch” as a way for people to hint at a new relationship in their life—rather than showing full commitment by posting a full-face photo of a new partner on their grid, folks are teasing the concept of a new boo by posting blurry or partially hidden pics on their story.\nAnd brands are doing it, too: teasing new products, concepts or services through soft launches on the ‘gram. It’s a way to hype up the news and create some buzz around the brand (similar to how a soft launch of your new boyfriend hopefully will instigate some gossip).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by Mejuri (@mejuri)\n\n\n\nHere’s an example from jewelry brand Mejuri. The business posted several videos leading up to a sale, and encouraged followers to sign up for a membership to get early access to the deals. Instead of giving away all of the information at once, they’re creating an exclusive opportunity and a bit of mystery.\nTrending Instagram hashtags\nTLDR: Instagram doesn’t publish a list of trending hashtags. So, we had to do some digging.\nThe best Instagram hashtags for you will depend on your specific niche, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for hashtagging on Instagram.\nPlus, using the most popular hashtags doesn’t necessarily mean your post will be successful: #love has been used more than two billion times, meaning that finding a specific post by searching that tag would be basically impossible.\nSo, let’s use an example: say I’m a baker from Vancouver posting some vegan chocolate chip cookies.\nHootsuite has a free hashtag generator to help you come up with ideas—once I type in a description and some keywords…\n\n… some great hashtags are generated for me.\n\nYou can also use the autocomplete on the explore page to come up with ideas–for example, this is what comes up when I start typing “vegan.”\n\nUsing Hootsuite’s social listening technology can also help to identify trending hashtags in your industry (start listening here).\nTrending audio on Instagram\nTrending audio is a little easier to find than trending hashtags, because audio is less niche-specific… but, audio trends change daily. What’s trending on Instagram at the time this post is written might not be trending at the time you’re reading it. So, instead of letting you know what’s’ trending as of the date this blog post is published (it’s “Stick Season”), here are some ways to find what audio is trending, well, now.\nTo find trending audio for an Instagram Reel, open the Instagram Reel editor and tap the music icon. From there, Instagram will show you music it thinks you’ll like. Any song with the “up” arrow next to it is trending upward.\n\nSource: Instagram\nWhen you’re watching Reels, you can also identify if the audio is trending by that arrow—it’s located in the bottom left of the screen.\n\nSource: Instagram\nIf you have more questions about Instagram audio, chances are we’ve answered them here.\nHow to identify and keep up with the latest Instagram trends\nBecause Instagram marketing trends are (literally) always changing and evolving, it’s important to develop strategies to keep up. Here are some hacks for staying in the game.\nRead a social media blog (like Hootsuite)\nWow, genius! You’re already doing it. Hootsuite — and other blogs like it, but come on, we’re the best — keeps up with social trends, conducts social media experiments and gathers useful information all in one spot. Follow social marketing platforms, subscribe to newsletters and check in often.\nFollow Instagram… on Instagram\nAnother no-brainer. Follow Instagram, Meta, and Adam Mosseri on IG, Linkedin, Threads and the platform formerly known as Twitter to stay up to date with new features—new technology often leads to new trends.\nUse the Explore page\nInstagram’s Explore page shows posts that the platform thinks you’ll like, but it’s also a great place to see what topics are on the rise. Just hit the “Search” field and the app will show you a bunch of subjects that are trending. Scroll to the left for more.\nFor example, at the moment this blog post is being written, topics like “pause challenge,” “christmas tree decoration,” “kitchen interior,” “motivational quotes,” “david beckham,” “short hair” and “pedro pascal” are trending.\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nSource: Instagram\nManage your Instagram presence alongside your other social channels and save time using Hootsuite.

However, these times can vary based on the specific audience and their online activity patterns. It would be beneficial to open one of these pages for more detailed information.

time to post on Instagram. Instagram’s visual nature makes it a desirable marketing platform for brands to get their offerings in front of as many eyes as possible, and knowing the best times to post on Instagram can be a major benefit to your social media strategy.\nRemember: with Instagram as a discovery platform of trends, brands, products or services, it’s important to get high-quality photos and content in front of potential consumers’ eyes at the right time.\nLearn how to identify your best times to post on Instagram with a free trial of Sprout Social and test our ViralPost® feature.\nStart a free Sprout Social trial\nDisclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded globally (not by Central Time), meaning you should be able to publish with the times provided in any timezone and see positive engagement results. Number of engagements represents total engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level engagement times. We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in 2024?\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\n\nWhen are the best times to post Reels on Instagram?\nAre the best times to post on Instagram different for static posts versus Reels? Perhaps there’s a definitive answer to that question, however, our data source is inclusive of posts, Stories and Reels. The information in this article should guide you to uncover the best times to post any content on Instagram to see positive engagement, whether it’s a static post, a Story with polls or a creative Reel.\nThe best times to post Reels on Instagram will be similar to our data above: weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. Our optimal send time data for Instagram is aggregate for Posts, Reels and Stories – both images and videos.\nFor that reason, we recommend you test posting Reels at different times to uncover the highest engagement times for you. Keep in mind that several factors go into Reels’ performance, whether it’s using trending sounds, the Instagram algorithm or having an engaging video hook to capture your audience’s attention.\n\n\nWhat is the best day and time to post on Instagram?\nWe know the best time to post on Instagram overall, but what about for each day of the week? If you’re looking for the best day and time to post on Instagram, read the analysis below.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Monday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Mondays is from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. While there’s decent engagement from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., optimal send and engagement times are those few hours during a typical lunch break.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Tuesday\nThere’s nearly double the highest engagement times on Tuesdays than there are on Mondays. The best time to post on Instagram on Tuesdays is from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Wednesday\nWednesdays see the highest engagement periods than any other day of the week, with even the moderately high engagement times spanning more hours than Tuesdays or Thursdays. The best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Thursday\nSimilar to Wednesdays, the best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and again at 2 p.m. The 1 p.m. hour drops slightly in engagement.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Friday\nBy the time users have reached the weekend, peak engagement hours dip; however, the majority of the workday still captures moderate engagement. Yet the best time to post on Instagram on Fridays is at 11 a.m., but can see almost as much engagement the few hours prior and after that peak engagement time.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Saturday\nGenerally speaking, we’ve noticed that Saturdays and Sundays have less engagement during the rest of the week across most social platforms. Even with Instagram, there’s a significant decrease during the weekends than during weekdays. With that in mind, you’ll still see light to average engagement on the app. The best time to post on Instagram on Saturdays is 9 a.m. to noon, in relation to the rest of the day.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Sunday\nSimilar to Saturdays, we’ve noticed Sundays have less engagement throughout the day across most, if not all, social platforms. In relation to the day itself, the best time to post on Instagram on Sundays is 10 a.m. to noon.\n\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in the UK?\nThe overall best time to post on Instagram in the UK is weekdays between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Midweek, engagement rates remain high until 4 p.m. Things are noticeably quieter at the weekend across many social platforms, including Instagram in the UK. Taking this into account, the best time to post on Saturday is 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 10 am to 12 p.m. on Sundays. If Instagram is the platform your UK audience engages with most, remember your industry, business goals and content will also play a part in the success of your social posts.\n\n\nWhat are the best times to post on Instagram by industry?\nThere’s no definitive answer to what the best times to post on Instagram are. We can only offer insight with the data we have. Industry is just one factor that plays into the success of your social posts. Consider as well as your target audience, business goals and the content itself.\nUse this industry-level data to help inform your publishing calendar, and test your optimal send times with social experiments.\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for hospitals & healthcare\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare:\n\nMondays at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.\nTuesdays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.\nThursdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.\nFridays from 11 a..m. to 3 p.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare: Tuesdays through Fridays\nWorst days to post on Instagram for Hospitals & Healthcare: Sundays\n\nHospitals, clinics and healthcare providers use social media for more than navigating healthcare crises.

But your brand’s numbers alone aren’t enough to give you a complete picture. You need to stay updated with the latest Instagram statistics to understand industry benchmarks and trends.\nStaying on top of the latest social media stats will help you anticipate changes and fine-tune your strategy accordingly. This is particularly true for a platform like Instagram, which evolves rapidly with new features.\nSo let’s take a look at some of the top Instagram stats that will inform your strategy for 2024.\nTable of contents\n\nInstagram user statistics\nInstagram usage statistics\nInstagram audience and demographics statistics\nInstagram advertising and marketing statistics\nInstagram Stories and Reels statistics\nInstagram for business statistics\nInstagram influencer statistics\nMaking the most of these Instagram stats\n\nInstagram user statistics\nUnderstanding how people perceive and use the platform will help you understand the best way to connect with them. This will help you develop Instagram best practices\xa0to implement in your strategy. These Instagram user statistics can give you a better look:\n1. Almost every Instagram user uses the app alongside other platforms\nAccording to data from Kepios, only\xa00.2% of Instagram users are unique to the platform. A large number of users use it alongside other social media platforms such as Facebook (80.8%), YouTube (77.4%) and TikTok (52.8%). That means having a solid cross-platform marketing strategy is crucial for your brand to succeed.\n2. Posting/sharing photos or videos continues to be the top activity\nIn previous years, people were largely using Instagram to post or share photos and videos. The numbers aren’t changing much in 2024 with the Kepios report showing that 70.4% of users are using the platform for this reason. This indicates a desire for users to be creative and express themselves.\n3. People are seeking entertainment on the platform\nThe same report shows that people are increasingly using the platform for entertainment. Looking for funny or entertaining content was the second most popular activity, with 64.8% of users engaging in it. So brands should get ahead by creating Instagram content that can entertain their audience.\nInstagram usage statistics\nHow popular is Instagram in terms of usage? Let’s take a look at these Instagram usage statistics to find out:\n4. There are 2 billion monthly active users on Instagram\nLatest reports show that Instagram has\xa02 billion monthly active users. While not at the Facebook level (over 3 billion), this is still huge\xa0for brands on Instagram. With the right strategies to get more Instagram followers, these users could turn into loyal fans of your brand.\n\n5. US adults spend 33 minutes per day on the platform\nVideo-based platforms like YouTube and TikTok have become a huge hit among social media users. At the same time, people are still spending a significant amount of time on Instagram. In fact, time spent on Instagram has seen a slight increase in the past year. U.S. adults are spending 33.1 minutes per day on the platform. This is a 3-minute increase from the previous year.\n\nSource: Insider Intelligence\nInstagram audience and demographics statistics\nUnderstanding Instagram’s demographics data gives you an idea of the types of people who use the platform. This helps you assess whether the platform is relevant to your target audience. Here’s a quick breakdown of Instagram statistics related to its audience and demographics.\n6. There are more male than female users\nBased on available data on Instagram users worldwide by gender, there are more male users (51.8%) than female users (48.2%) as of January 2023. The audience is a near even split, meaning the platform isn’t inherently better for reaching one demographic audience over another.\n7. Instagram is most popular among younger audiences\nThe platform sees the highest usage among people\xa0aged between 18 and 34. People within these age groups make up over 60% of Instagram’s user base. As such, the platform is ideal if your target audience consists of young adults and Millennials.\n\nSource: Statista\n8. India and the United States have the greatest number of users\nMuch like other platforms, India leads the way even when it comes to Instagram. The country has\xa0229.5 million Instagram users. The United States comes next with 149.35 million users.\nInstagram advertising and marketing statistics\nAre you getting the most out of your\xa0Instagram advertising\xa0efforts? Is it even worth it to market your brand on Instagram? Here are a few Instagram stats to give you the answers you need.\n9. Instagram ad reach is growing\nAlong with the increase in users, Instagram is offering an increase in ad reach. The Instagram statistics report from Kepios shows a 12.2% year-over-year increase in ad reach. This makes the platform an ideal choice for brands that want to advertise on Instagram.\n10. In-feed ads make up most of the platform’s ad revenue\nOberlo reports that Instagram ad revenue reached $50.58 billion in 2023. Out of this, in-feed ads were a major contributor. Meanwhile, ads on Instagram Stories made up 26.7% of the platform’s ad revenue. In 2024, it’s anticipated that Instagram ad revenue will reach $59.6 billion.\n\n11. Feed ads have a higher click-through rate (CTR) than Stories ads\nA likely explanation for the preference of in-feed ads is the higher click-through rate (CTR)\nBrafton reports that the\xa0CTR for feed ads on Instagram ranges between 0.22% and 0.88%. Meanwhile, Stories ads have a CTR between 0.33% and 0.54%.\nThese numbers suggest that in-feed ads have a higher potential to drive clicks than Stories ads.

Brands see an average conversion rate of 1%\nBazaarvoice found that the average conversion rate for top-performing brands on Instagram was 1%. During this analysis, it discovered a close relationship between reach and conversion rate.\nInterestingly, it’s no longer just the brands with smaller followings that are boasting higher conversions. Brands having up to 100k followers did see higher-than-average conversions compared to last year (1.1% vs. 0.3%). And those with fewer than 10k followers still boast the highest conversion rate (1.3%), but not as much of a lead as last year (2.6%). However, brands having between 500k and 1 million followers had similar conversion rates as past years (0.7%).\n\nSource: Bazaarvoice\nInstagram Stories and Reels statistics\nInstagram offers a wide range of content types to choose from, with Stories and Reels being popular options. Check out these Stories and Reels statistics to see how these formats are performing:\n14. Story reach rate is picking back up\nIn spite of a decline in the previous years, the reach rate for Instagram Stories is finally starting to rise again. According to a RivalQ study, smaller brands with under 10k followers experienced the most significant increase (35%) in Story reach rate. Other groups experienced minor increases while the reach rate for mid-size brands flatlined.\n\nSource: RivalIQ\n15. Retention rate continues to decline with an increase in the number of frames\nThe same Rival IQ study found that the number of frames you post to your Instagram Stories determines how well you retain your audience. After a major dip from the first two frames, the median retention rate remains at 81% by the fourth frame. Story retention rate starts to dip below 75% after the seventh frame.\n16. Short narrative-type Stories are the most popular format\nWhen it comes to the types of Stories that people want to see, short narratives are the most popular. Thirty-five percent of consumers\xa0prefer these types of Stories with a mix of photos, videos and text. Stories with quizzes and polls were another popular option.\nSo if you’re running out of\xa0Instagram Story ideas, use these stats to brainstorm new ideas that engage your audience.\n\nSource: HubSpot\n17. Reels still have the highest reach rate\nSince their introduction, Reels have continued to surpass other content types in terms of reach. A Socialinsider study found that Reels see an average reach rate of 30.81%. That’s double the reach rate of other content formats. Even in terms of impressions, Reels surpass other post types with 2x more impressions.\n\nHowever, this upward trend could soon end as the visibility of Reels experiences a slowdown. The RivalIQ study from earlier found that Reels had the smallest increase in reach compared to other post types.\n18. Reels engagement is dropping\nOn that note, engagement rates for Instagram Reels are starting to drop. The SocialInsider study found a 25% decline in Reels engagement over 2023.\nThat said, the average engagement rate for Instagram Reels still stands at 1.23% per post and it continues to be the most engaging Instagram post type.\n\nSource: SocialInsider\nThe declining numbers in engagement don’t mean brands should stop creating Reels. Rather, it indicates a need to create Reels content that engages your audience.

Tell me more! At the forefront of social media since 2010, Instagram has become not only a staple in our phones’ app libraries but also in our everyday lives. With\xa0more than 2 billion active users this fall, the social media giant’s popularity is projected to grow to even greater heights over the coming year. Hoffmann Murtaugh has the exclusive insights every social media marketer needs to know about the Instagram trend forecast for 2022.\xa0Get Ready For A Ride On The Carousel, The Latest Instagram Trend!Instagram users rejoice in knowing that their ‘weekly photo dumps’ aren’t going anywhere in 2022! While the emerging Instagram trend of sharing a user’s top 10 photos to summarize their week is typically for fun, the feature also can positively impact a brand’s marketing strategy. With more content for Instagram users to scroll through and engage within a carousel, consumers are spending more time looking at a brand’s post, and ultimately, at a brand’s Instagram page overall. Plan on seeing more tailored, curated Instagram carousel posts as we head into the new year.\xa0Enhanced Instagram Shopping User ExperienceWhether avoidance of COVID-19 pandemic surges or new habits that have been formed, online shopping is huge. In fact, 54 percent of consumers prefer to shop online. Expect Instagram Shopping to take off in 2022 as more brands become acquainted with the digital storefront feature. Seamlessly and organically integrated within the app, Instagram takes consumers through the entire purchasing experience. Businesses can maximize their sales to broader audiences by exploring all Instagram Shopping has to offer in 2022.\xa0The Continued Rise Of Influencer MarketingHave you purchased a product from someone’s Instagram recommendation? Instagram has been a pioneer in providing a platform for users to follow people whose lifestyles, fashion, fitness, advice, piques their interest and inspiration. As social media influencers gain traction and develop their own communities on Instagram, brands are taking notice. Brands need to start investing in paid partnerships with Instagram users relevant to their target audience. 2022 will expose the full potential of influencers (of all account sizes) in amplifying a brand’s social media marketing efforts.\xa0Gen Z Has Entered The ChatSpeaking of influence—let’s talk about some of the youngest Instagram users driving the incoming trends to fleeting success. Making up approximately 20 percent of the population, Generation Z (those born between 1997-2012) Instagram users have utilized many of the social media network’s unique features to share creative, engaging content with friends, families, and classmates. In a current world of remote learning and limited social gatherings, Instagram allows Gen Z to make up fun dances on Reels, share their music favorites on Stories, and thrifted finds from Shopping. Not only does this generation make use of Instagram’s capabilities, but Gen Z also sparks a conversation for social change. These young users encourage their favorite brands to stand up for causes that matter most to them. Don’t underestimate the power of Gen Z and how they will reshape the narrative on brands on Instagram in 2022.Which Instagram trend from 2021 was your favorite? What feature are you most looking forward to utilizing for your marketing strategy in 2022?

time to post on Instagram. Instagram’s visual nature makes it a desirable marketing platform for brands to get their offerings in front of as many eyes as possible, and knowing the best times to post on Instagram can be a major benefit to your social media strategy.\nRemember: with Instagram as a discovery platform of trends, brands, products or services, it’s important to get high-quality photos and content in front of potential consumers’ eyes at the right time.\nLearn how to identify your best times to post on Instagram with a free trial of Sprout Social and test our ViralPost® feature.\nStart a free Sprout Social trial\nDisclaimer: Data from Sprout Social include users from various plan types, industries and locations. All time frames are recorded globally (not by Central Time), meaning you should be able to publish with the times provided in any timezone and see positive engagement results. Number of engagements represents total engagements a brand received on the specific channel during that hour time frame. Industry-specific data includes mid- to high-level engagement times. We recommend testing with your own accounts to find the most optimal send times.\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in 2024?\n\n\nBest times to post on Instagram:\n\nMondays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nTuesdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nWednesdays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nThursdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\nFridays at 11 a.m.\n\n\nBest days to post on Instagram: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays\nWorst days to post on Instagram: Sundays\n\nWhere Facebook was the most-used platform by marketers worldwide, Instagram comes in second at 80%. Interestingly, Instagram ties with Facebook for the social media platforms that offer marketers the highest ROI at 29%. This is because social media continues to evolve with ecommerce and offering frictionless experiences to users. And even though the competition for short-form video between Instagram and TikTok continues to heat up, Reels still generate more likes and saves than static Instagram posts.\nThe best times to post on Instagram are weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. We recommend scheduling posts Tuesdays through Thursdays between 10 and and 3 p.m. for optimal engagement. It’s wise to test these benchmarks against your current metrics too.\nInstagram has grown a long way since its photo-only days. The app, which has 2 billion monthly active users, is a platform to share images, videos, Reels and live streams, just to name a few creative content types. It is also an avenue to collaborate and partner with other brands and provides a stream of revenue through its ecommerce capabilities.\nThe Instagram algorithm is unpredictable. To be successful on the platform is a balance of consistently posting high-quality content that will engage and entertain your audiences. That’s a lot to ask for with each piece of content published. But using that as a guiding post can help with your Instagram marketing strategy.\n\n\nWhen are the best times to post Reels on Instagram?\nAre the best times to post on Instagram different for static posts versus Reels? Perhaps there’s a definitive answer to that question, however, our data source is inclusive of posts, Stories and Reels. The information in this article should guide you to uncover the best times to post any content on Instagram to see positive engagement, whether it’s a static post, a Story with polls or a creative Reel.\nThe best times to post Reels on Instagram will be similar to our data above: weekdays generally between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with Tuesdays and Wednesdays engagement times extending to 4 p.m. Our optimal send time data for Instagram is aggregate for Posts, Reels and Stories – both images and videos.\nFor that reason, we recommend you test posting Reels at different times to uncover the highest engagement times for you. Keep in mind that several factors go into Reels’ performance, whether it’s using trending sounds, the Instagram algorithm or having an engaging video hook to capture your audience’s attention.\n\n\nWhat is the best day and time to post on Instagram?\nWe know the best time to post on Instagram overall, but what about for each day of the week? If you’re looking for the best day and time to post on Instagram, read the analysis below.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Monday\nThe best time to post on Instagram on Mondays is from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. While there’s decent engagement from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., optimal send and engagement times are those few hours during a typical lunch break.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Tuesday\nThere’s nearly double the highest engagement times on Tuesdays than there are on Mondays. The best time to post on Instagram on Tuesdays is from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Wednesday\nWednesdays see the highest engagement periods than any other day of the week, with even the moderately high engagement times spanning more hours than Tuesdays or Thursdays. The best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Thursday\nSimilar to Wednesdays, the best times to post on Instagram on Thursdays are from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and again at 2 p.m. The 1 p.m. hour drops slightly in engagement.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Friday\nBy the time users have reached the weekend, peak engagement hours dip; however, the majority of the workday still captures moderate engagement. Yet the best time to post on Instagram on Fridays is at 11 a.m., but can see almost as much engagement the few hours prior and after that peak engagement time.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Saturday\nGenerally speaking, we’ve noticed that Saturdays and Sundays have less engagement during the rest of the week across most social platforms. Even with Instagram, there’s a significant decrease during the weekends than during weekdays. With that in mind, you’ll still see light to average engagement on the app. The best time to post on Instagram on Saturdays is 9 a.m. to noon, in relation to the rest of the day.\nBest time to post on Instagram on Sunday\nSimilar to Saturdays, we’ve noticed Sundays have less engagement throughout the day across most, if not all, social platforms. In relation to the day itself, the best time to post on Instagram on Sundays is 10 a.m. to noon.\n\n\nWhen is the best time to post on Instagram in the UK?\nThe overall best time to post on Instagram in the UK is weekdays between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Midweek, engagement rates remain high until 4 p.m. Things are noticeably quieter at the weekend across many social platforms, including Instagram in the UK. Taking this into account, the best time to post on Saturday is 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 10 am to 12 p.m. on Sundays. If Instagram is the platform your UK audience engages with most, remember your industry, business goals and content will also play a part in the success of your social posts.\n\n\nWhat are the best times to post on Instagram by industry?\nThere’s no definitive answer to what the best times to post on Instagram are. We can only offer insight with the data we have. Industry is just one factor that plays into the success of your social posts.

I encountered an error while trying to use the tool. This was the error: Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': "This model's maximum context length is 8192 tokens. However, your messages resulted in 11081 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages.", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': 'messages', 'code': 'context_length_exceeded'}}.
 Tool Ask question to co-worker accepts these inputs: Ask question to co-worker(question: str, context: str, coworker: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs) - Ask a specific question to one of the following co-workers: [Instagram Market Researcher
, Instagram Copywriter
]
The input to this tool should be the co-worker, the question you have for them, and ALL necessary context to ask the question properly, they know nothing about the question, so share absolute everything you know, don't reference things but instead explain them.
[00m
[32;1m[1;3mGiven the repeated errors due to context length, I’ll break down my request to the Instagram Market Researcher into smaller, more manageable parts. I will start by asking for the latest Instagram trends. 

Thought: I need to gather information about the latest Instagram trends to incorporate into the content strategy.

Action: Ask question to co-worker
Action Input: {"question": "Can you provide the latest Instagram trends?", "context": "I need the latest Instagram trends to align our weekly content strategy with current market conditions.", "coworker": "Instagram Market Researcher"}

However, if you keep up with the latest Instagram trends, you can leverage these trends as part of your Instagram marketing strategy that grabs attention and fuels growth.\nIn this article, we dive deep into the top nine Instagram trends for 2024. We’ll cover innovative tactics like AI-driven content creation and community building with examples to incorporate them into your own Instagram strategy.\n1. Video takes priority over images\nDo me a favor: Open your Instagram app and scroll through the first 10 to 15 pieces of content. As you scroll, you might notice a common theme—most of the posts are videos.\nInstagram continues to prioritize video—specifically Reels—in 2024. In fact, the platform is regularly releasing new features to encourage creators to make more video content.\nFor example, you can now:\n\nReply to a Reel with another Reel\nAdd new effects, music and voice overs to your Reels\nUpload video stories up to 60 seconds long with no cuts\nHost interactive live streams\n\nLeaning hard into video isn’t just encouraged at this point—it’s essential to thrive on Instagram right now. Convey your brand’s authentic personality. Show your products in action. Give behind-the-scenes glimpses of your team. Talk to your followers in real-time.\nUsing video not only helps you build genuine connections with your audience—it also drives reach and engagement by appealing to the Instagram algorithm.\nInstagram Reel trends for 2024\nInstagram Reels launched in 2020 and slowly rolled out to all users throughout 2021. This micro video addition to Instagram was created to compete with Snapchat and TikTok. It has continued to grow in popularity. Many brands and content creators will repurpose their videos across each of the platforms—TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.\nHere are some Instagram Reel trends popular with brands this year:\nSocial media managers acting as brand spokespeople\nInstead of hiring paid actors to deliver scripted messages, social media managers are now stepping in front of the camera when creating Reels.\nSocial media managers have an intimate understanding of the brand’s voice and values. And they’re able to quickly create content that deeply resonates with the audience at a fraction of the cost. Our social media managers here at Sprout Social hop into Reels from time to time to act as spokespeople for our social media marketing software:\n\nAn added bonus to this is that social media managers’ appearances help build stronger personal connections between the brand and its customers over time.\nVideo memes\nMemes, of course, still are trending on Instagram. Brands are remixing meme Reels with trending audio and putting their own spin on funny clips or pop culture references to be relevant to their brand and audience like Visme did.\n\nRemember to align your meme content with brand values while still showing the lighter side of your business. When done right, it can get lots of positive engagement when you’re conscious to position your brand as relatable and culturally aware.\nInstagram post trends for 2024\nJust because Reels are trending on Instagram doesn’t mean static posts are dead. If you look at your feed, a good 25-30% is likely still are image, video and carousel posts.\nInstagram has also rolled out a small but decent update in this area. You can now add audio to static posts to make them more engaging.\nBrands continue to use Instagram posts in unique, creative ways. Here are some noteworthy trends to watch and try this year:\nPhoto dump\nThis Instagram post trend is specific to carousels. The photo dump involves sharing a series of images that may seem candid and unrelated at first glance but collectively convey a story or a theme.\nIt’s like flipping through someone’s personal photo album. It offers a glimpse into behind-the-scenes moments. For brands, these moments could include events, user-generated content and photoshoots. For example, Coach used this trend to showcase their fashion collection for Fall 2024.\nText posts\nTraditionally, Instagram has been all about the visuals. However, at the moment, there’s a growing trend of text posts. The theme is to make the text post a static image or flip-through series within a carousel.\nBrands are posting stats, listicles, tips, how-tos, quotes, announcements, customer testimonials and more as aesthetically pleasing, minimalistic text posts that align with their branding.\nText posts stand out in a visually saturated feed and are great for offering bite-sized value or sparking conversation with followers.\nHere is an example from Sprout Social:\n\nSoft launches to tease products\nBrands are teasing new products through “soft launch” posts. They are portraying new products with subtle hints, behind-the-scenes peeks or cryptic messages. Usually they are dropping a few posts over a period of time to create anticipation and hype for the launch of new products from those following.\nThis is an excellent strategy for engaging your audience to peak curiosity about what’s coming next. Additionally, creating buzz around a product before its official launch helps generate early interest and demand.\nCheck out how Huda Beauty did this soft launch Reel seamlessly:\n\n2. Empower social content creation with AI\nJust like most other tech brands, Instagram—and its parent company Meta—is investing heavily in AI this year. For marketers, this trend could seriously change the way they create content.\nCurrently, Instagram offers the following AI features for creators in specific regions:\n\nAI generated stickers: Users can enter prompts to create custom AI stickers. From there, they can send those stickers in chats or add them to their stories.\nStart a chat with AI: Ask for recommendations and advice, talk about interests, and even view and follow AI profiles and the content they post.\nAI backdrops for stories: When you share a photo to your story, use the AI backdrop tool to create a new background based on a text prompt.\n\nMark Zuckerburg has also announced two new AI capabilities that might soon come to Instagram—AI image editing and high quality video generation. Users would be able to quickly remove unwanted objects, manipulate images, change the background and generate creative, original video clips that match their vision by simply typing in prompts.\nAside from using Instagram’s built-in AI features, brands are tapping into third-party AI tools to create content quickly and easily. For example, you can use Sprout Social’s AI capabilities to analyze sentiment, share posts at just the right time, write engaging captions, brainstorm campaign ideas, generate competitor reports and personalize support messages.\n\nBut does this mean AI is going to replace social media managers completely? Not anytime soon. It is, however, increasingly becoming a part of social media strategies.\nAI can help marketers slash time in half by automating certain tasks and accelerating creative processes. Used smartly, it can help you scale content creation, improve user experiences, drive more engagement and stay ahead of the competition.\n3. Increase engagement with community experiences\nDriving engagement on Instagram takes more than just a pretty feed. With the algorithm now actively favoring genuine community engagement and interaction, brands need to prioritize building connections with their audiences.\nFor example, Instagram launched broadcast channels last year as a one way messaging tool for creators to engage with their followers. These channels will give creators an opportunity to give the latest updates to their followers in a more intimate and interactive space.\nThis is an example of Quek Shio‘s broadcast channel to get a better understanding of what they look like:\n\nCurrently, creators can send text, photo, video and voice notes in broadcast channels. They can also share question cards and polls to gather fan feedback. However, it’s still unclear whether this feature will expand to business accounts or if it will remain just for digital content creators.\nAlternatively, brands can add followers to their Close Friends list to share exclusive content, stories, offers and updates. Gather feedback, answer questions, share behind-the-scenes footage and even create an exclusive list for customers only.\nInvite people to join your Close Friends list by talking about it in a post or story like Tina Davies Professional.\n4. Increase traffic with multiple links from bio\nRemember the good ol’ link in bio?\nPreviously, you could only add one link to your Instagram profile. Most marketers relied on tools like Linktree to condense all their important channels and pages into a single link.\nNow, you can include up to five external links in your Instagram bio. See Ring Concierge’s Instagram profile to see how they show up when you click into them: \nFor omnichannel brands, this is a huge opportunity to drive traffic to multiple channels and touchpoints. A retail brand could take users to their best selling product page, FAQs section, YouTube channel and online shop. A SaaS brand could send people to their highest converting landing page, latest blog post and a new downloadable eBook.\nHere’s how to add multiple links to your bio:\n\nOpen the Instagram app\nTap on your account\nTap Edit profile under your profile picture\nTap Add links\nTap + Add external link\nEnter the URL and title of the link you want to add\nHit Done in the top right corner\nTap + Add external link again to add another link\n\nYou can also delete links and/or change them anytime you want. This offers a lot of flexibility to brands that want to boost new campaigns and content on channels other than Instagram.\n5. Boost visibility using Instagram SEO\nSocial search is a rapidly growing trend. Last year, a combined 29% of Gen Z and Millennials flocked to social media platforms instead of actual search engines to find information. And this number continues to grow in 2024.\nOptimizing for native search is more important than ever. Instagram’s algorithm is working constantly to deliver relevant, personalized and intent based content to users’ feeds. To stand out, marketers need an Instagram SEO strategy that goes beyond just using the right hashtags.\nHere are some tips to help your Instagram content rank higher in Explore and user feeds:\n\nFind the right keywords: Pinpoint specific keywords your audience is searching for to guide your content creation strategy. For instance, if there’s a rising interest in vegan recipes, create content around keywords like “vegan breakfast ideas” or “plant-based dinners.”\nOptimize subtitles and captions: Incorporate keywords into the text part of your Instagram posts and stories. Use them in subtitles, captions, tags and stickers. Don’t forget to keep it engaging. You could start with a question like “Who else loves smoothie bowls?” to prompt user engagement and include keywords naturally.\nFollow and engage with similar accounts: Actively comment on and like posts from accounts in your niche, such as other vegan food bloggers, to increase visibility and encourage cross-engagement.\nAdd alt text to your posts: Adding descriptive alt text to images, like “vegan avocado toast on a rustic table,” improves your post’s accessibility and helps Instagram’s algorithm understand and categorize your content better.\nHop on the latest trends: Stay updated with viral hashtags or challenges and incorporate them when relevant. If #Veganuary is trending, join the conversation by sharing your unique vegan recipes or tips.\nStick to the official guidelines: Ensure your content follows Instagram’s recommendation guidelines to boost its chances of ranking higher in feeds and showing up in front of the right audiences.\n\n6. Create brand partnerships with native Instagram tools\nInstagram has long been the top platform for brands and influencers to work together. It’s easy to see why—consumers are 1.5x more likely to be interested in viewing branded creator content on Instagram than on other platforms.\nIn 2024, Instagram is taking brand collaborations more seriously than ever. They’ve already introduced a bunch of tools and features to facilitate these partnerships.\nFor example, brands can allow other Instagram accounts, such as influencers or partners, to add product tags in their posts. Users who click on these tags will be taken directly to the brand’s Instagram shop and would be able to check out on the platform.\nBrands can also share collaborative posts with partners and influencers. Users can “invite collaborators” to a post as well as tag brands in paid partnerships, having both involved accounts show up—and publishing the post to both collaborators’ profiles.\nTo see what they look like, check out this collaborative post done by food blogger, Appetite Foodie, and Bang Bang Oriental, a food hall in London:\n\nBut perhaps the most exciting update is the launch of Instagram’s Creator Marketplace. It’s kind of like Instagram’s own influencer management platform where brands can find creators to work with, share campaign ideas and structured outlines with them, manage communication, discuss compensation and more all in one place.\n\nImage Source: Instagram\nCreator Marketplace is currently only available to brands in the US. Businesses interested in joining the marketplace can fill out this form.\n7. Food content is trending on Instagram\nIf you’ve been on Instagram for a while, you know food content is big on the platform. We’re not just talking beautiful, mouthwatering photos of food. This year, it’s also about quick, easy and healthy recipes and Reels users can’t stop watching.\nAnd it makes sense. Most people on Instagram are 18-34 years old—an age group that significantly contributes to food culture online. On top of that, Gen Z isn’t afraid of what’s trending on the plate. In fact, they’re fascinated by it. A notable 45% are intrigued by vegan products, while 42% are willing to try plant based meat.\nPlus, when you look at larger societal shifts towards saving money as well as health, wellness and mindful eating, it’s easy to see why users want more content about making and consuming restaurant quality food at home.\nFor food and restaurant brands, this presents a major opportunity on Instagram. Get creative with easy-to-follow recipe tutorials, cooking tips or mouthwatering food styling Reels. Go live while preparing customer favorites or spotlighting local farms that supply your ingredients.\nHere is an example of how The Baker’s Grove in New Jersey did it well:\n\nThese bites of food content, especially when optimized with Instagram hashtags and captions that spark conversation, can drive huge visibility for your business.\nNot just for restaurants, brands selling kitchenware, meal services, courses and more can all capitalize on users’ cravings for cooking inspiration. Show how your product can help them elevate homemade meals or present enticing close-ups of dishes your item helped prepare.\nEven brands in unrelated verticals should incorporate food content when possible. Take this example from IKEA:\n\nThere are opportunities to spotlight office kitchen areas or cafes. Show your team enjoying meals prepared by featured vendors. Genuinely connect with audiences over universal topics like favorite comfort foods or go to late night snacks.\nFood has exceptional power to build strong, personal connections. Find creative ways to incorporate food content into your Instagram strategy while keeping it relevant to position your brand for growth in 2024.\n8. Leverage user generated content\nUser-generated content (UGC) currently dominates Instagram—for good reason. Hard selling promotional tactics don’t work anymore. People now crave authenticity and relatability, especially on a platform they’re spending hours on daily.\nAnd the strongest brands tap into this free marketing by creatively repurposing posts from real customers. It’s the most powerful way to build trust, drive engagement and grow on the platform.\nSo, how do you get your hands on quality Instagram UGC?\nBig brands like BMW, Samsung and Apple use hashtags to source user-generated content.\n\n#shotoniphone has 29.6 million posts\n#bmwrepost has 2.8 million posts\n#withgalaxy has 1.9 million posts\n\nSamsung has even created a separate Instagram account to showcase UGC. Creators looking to get some exposure on the platform gladly tag photos taken with their Samsung devices with #withGalaxy for a chance to be featured on the brand’s page—which has an impressive following of 4.8 million users.\n\nAnother way to encourage UGC is to run competitions and reward the best entry or entries. Or, partner with influencers and creators in your niche. Ask them to share honest product reviews or send them free PR packages to create unboxing videos you can repost on your brand’s page.\nJake the Bengal, the cat influencer, and Cheerble, the Pet Store, created a collaborative paid partnership post to advertise Cheerble’s cat toy.\n\nYou can ask permission to repost organic stories and posts featuring your product from non influencer public accounts. These are highly effective as they show genuinely happy customers using your brand in their day-to-day lives.\n9. Paid promotions expand your reach\nAs the popularity of social media platforms grows, the need for algorithms to best serve their users also grows. And when an algorithm is deciding who gets served your content, you might see a decline in reach. Because of this, Instagram paid promotions are a growing trend in 2024.\nLet’s go back to our exercise from the first trend, where we scrolled down to see the first 10 to 20 posts.\nIf your feed was anything like mine, you saw about nine Reels, six regular posts and five sponsored posts. That means about 25% of your feed is filled with paid ads, like the Deel one below.\n\nWhile that might seem like a lot, let’s look at it from a different perspective. It also means that 25% of your target audience’s feed is filled with sponsored posts. And that if you start investing in Instagram ads, your brand can own part of that 25%.\nUse Instagram trends to update your strategy\nThousands of factors influence Instagram trends—other platforms, new features, consumer behavior and societal shifts are just a few. Keeping up with the current trends on Instagram freshens up your content and shows your audience you’re not afraid to try new things.\nLooking to level up your Instagram marketing in 2024?

Tell me more! At the forefront of social media since 2010, Instagram has become not only a staple in our phones’ app libraries but also in our everyday lives. With\xa0more than 2 billion active users this fall, the social media giant’s popularity is projected to grow to even greater heights over the coming year. Hoffmann Murtaugh has the exclusive insights every social media marketer needs to know about the Instagram trend forecast for 2022.\xa0Get Ready For A Ride On The Carousel, The Latest Instagram Trend!Instagram users rejoice in knowing that their ‘weekly photo dumps’ aren’t going anywhere in 2022! While the emerging Instagram trend of sharing a user’s top 10 photos to summarize their week is typically for fun, the feature also can positively impact a brand’s marketing strategy. With more content for Instagram users to scroll through and engage within a carousel, consumers are spending more time looking at a brand’s post, and ultimately, at a brand’s Instagram page overall. Plan on seeing more tailored, curated Instagram carousel posts as we head into the new year.\xa0Enhanced Instagram Shopping User ExperienceWhether avoidance of COVID-19 pandemic surges or new habits that have been formed, online shopping is huge. In fact, 54 percent of consumers prefer to shop online. Expect Instagram Shopping to take off in 2022 as more brands become acquainted with the digital storefront feature. Seamlessly and organically integrated within the app, Instagram takes consumers through the entire purchasing experience. Businesses can maximize their sales to broader audiences by exploring all Instagram Shopping has to offer in 2022.\xa0The Continued Rise Of Influencer MarketingHave you purchased a product from someone’s Instagram recommendation? Instagram has been a pioneer in providing a platform for users to follow people whose lifestyles, fashion, fitness, advice, piques their interest and inspiration. As social media influencers gain traction and develop their own communities on Instagram, brands are taking notice. Brands need to start investing in paid partnerships with Instagram users relevant to their target audience. 2022 will expose the full potential of influencers (of all account sizes) in amplifying a brand’s social media marketing efforts.\xa0Gen Z Has Entered The ChatSpeaking of influence—let’s talk about some of the youngest Instagram users driving the incoming trends to fleeting success. Making up approximately 20 percent of the population, Generation Z (those born between 1997-2012) Instagram users have utilized many of the social media network’s unique features to share creative, engaging content with friends, families, and classmates. In a current world of remote learning and limited social gatherings, Instagram allows Gen Z to make up fun dances on Reels, share their music favorites on Stories, and thrifted finds from Shopping. Not only does this generation make use of Instagram’s capabilities, but Gen Z also sparks a conversation for social change. These young users encourage their favorite brands to stand up for causes that matter most to them. Don’t underestimate the power of Gen Z and how they will reshape the narrative on brands on Instagram in 2022.Which Instagram trend from 2021 was your favorite?

I have found a valuable source that outlines four key Instagram trends to watch for in 2022. These include: the use of carousel posts, a more enhanced Instagram shopping experience, the rise of influencer marketing, and the impact of Generation Z. I will use this information to form my final answer.

Final Answer: Based on the Hoffmann Murtaugh's blog post, here are the four key Instagram trends to watch for in 2022:

1. Carousel Posts: Instagram users are increasingly sharing a collection of their top 10 photos to summarize their week. This feature can also positively impact a brand’s marketing strategy as it keeps consumers engaged for longer.

2. Enhanced Instagram Shopping User Experience: With the rise of online shopping, Instagram Shopping is set to take off in 2022 as more brands become acquainted with the digital storefront feature. This feature allows businesses to showcase their products directly on Instagram and facilitate in-app purchases.

3. The Continued Rise of Influencer Marketing: Brands are increasingly investing in paid partnerships with Instagram influencers who are relevant to their target audience. This trend is expected to grow in 2022, as influencers can help to amplify a brand’s social media marketing efforts.

4. Generation Z's Impact: Generation Z users (those born between 1997-2012) are using Instagram's features to share creative content and spark conversations about social change. This young demographic is reshaping how brands present themselves on Instagram.

These trends can be leveraged to align your weekly content strategy with current market conditions on Instagram.[0m
